At the  same  instant    Nick  hit  the  barrel  and  threw  himself  upon  the  smaller  man      
The  gun  fired  next  to  his  ear  with  a  vicious  whoosh  like  the  first  stroke  of  an  old  steam  engine      
At  the  same  instant    Elaine  screamed  wildly    the  sound  ending  abruptly  as  Nick  went  off  the  boat  and  into  the  water  on  top  of  the  frantic    struggling  Poet      
The  moment  the  sea  closed  over  Nick    some  atavistic  sense  warned  him  that  he  would  survive  in  this  alien  element  only  if  he  did  not  panic      
But  the  murderer  to  whom  he  clung  had  a  tremendous  antage      
The  wide  flippers  on  Poets  feet  gave  his  legs  incredible  power    driving  the  two  of  them  down  into  the  water  as  they  rolled  over  and  over      
Poet  was  the  captured    arms  pinioned  to  his  side    and  he  twisted  convulsively  trying  to  escape      
Poet  would  escape    Nick  thought  grimly    because  he  wore  the  apparatus  which  would  keep  him  alive  under  water      
But  Nick  would  not  let  go      
The  rubber  and  glass  face  mask  slipped  from  Poets  forehead    bounced  painlessly  off  Nicks  chin    then  disappeared      
Poet  twisted  again  and  Nicks  knuckles  scraped  on  the  air  tank    ripping  off  the  skin      
For  a  split  second    Nick  relaxed  his  grip  and  Poets  slippery  body  spun  completely  around  before  Nick  could  stop  him    holding  him  now  from  the  rear      
Something  flailed  at  the  side  of  Nicks  head  as  they  rolled  around  and  around      
Suddenly  Poet  stopped  struggling  and  the  two  of  them  hung  suspended  in  the  water    not  rising    not  sinking      
A  sharp  pain  lanced  across  Nicks  chest  and  a  bubble  of  air  escaped  from  his  tortured  lungs    joining  dozens  of  others  that  sailed  lazily  toward  the  surface  like  helium  balloons  rising  into  the  sky      
A  black    snakelike  object  swayed  eerily  in  front  of  him    spewing  bubbles  from  its  flat  cobra  head      
The  air  hose  was  free        
The  discovery  struck  Nick  like  a  blow      
Desperately    Nick  flashed  one  hand  up    catching  Poets  neck  in  the  bend  of  his  elbow      
At  the  same  instant    he  grabbed  the  loose    writhing  hose  with  his  other  hand  and  bit  down  on  the  hard  rubber  mouthpiece      
Instinctively  he  exhaled  through  his  nose  then  sucked  in  the  air  from  the  hose      
At  once  the  excruciating  pain  in  his  chest  stopped  and  he  was  seized  with  a  sudden    wild  exultation      
As  if  this  was  a  signal    Poet  abruptly  began  to  thrash  the  water  and  the  quick  movement  slowly  made  them  sink  through  the  water      
Relentlessly    Nick  held  on    sucking  on  the  hose    inhaling  the  air  that  belonged  to  Poet      
Poet  was  not  fighting  Nick  now      
Harbor  Point  sticks  out  into  the  ocean  like  the  fat  neck  of  a  steamer  clam      
Its  a  rich  village  but  not  much  for  action    too  many  solid  residents    not  enough  tourists  or  working  stiffs      
Its  at  the  far  end  of  the  county  and  the  last  time  I  came  here  was  for  a  hit  and  run  manslaughter    about  seven  months  ago      
Chief  Bob  Moore  looked  his  same  hickself        
a  man  mountain  running  to  lard  in  his  middleage      
Seeing  me  he  said  with  real  surprise   Well    well    aint  we  honored        
Hardly  expected  the  head  of  County  Homicide  up  for  this  murder      
You  sure  climbed  fast    Jed      
Rookie  investigator  last  summer  and  now  its  Inspector  Jed      
Took  me  19  years  to  become  Chief  of  our  three  man  police  force      
Proves  a  college  education  pays  off        
His  sarcasm  was  followed  by  a  stupid  grin  of  his  thick  mouth  and  bad  teeth      
  I  guess  it  helps      I  said    paying  no  attention  to  his  ribbing      
  Never  could  figure  out  why  you  ever  wanted  to  be  a  cop    Jed      
Youre  not  only  young  but  well    you  dont  even  look  like  a  police  officer      
A  runt  with  narrow  shoulders  and  that  brush  haircut  hell    youd  pass  for  a  juvenile  delinquent  of  the  hotrod  set      
In  my  day  the  first  requirement  for  a  cop  was  to  look  like  the  law    big  and  tough      
Man    when  my  275  pounds  and  sixfour  comes  along    why  its  the  same  as  another  badge      
When  I  say  move    a  guy  moves          
  Dont  worry  about  my  being  tough    Moore      
Also    its  far  too  early  in  the  day  for  corny  lines  like  the  bigger  they  come  Youve  had  your  gassy  lecture    lets  get  to  work      
Who  was  the  murdered  woman  Mrs  Buck          
  Widow    nice  sort  of  woman      
Comfortably  fixed      
Ran  a  fairsized  farm      
Came  to  the  Harbor  as  a  bride  and  Dont  worry  Jed    this  one  is  in  the  bag      
I  know  the  killer    have  the  only  road  off  the  peninsula  covered        
  Yeah    passed  your  road  block  as  I  drove  in      I  said    sitting  on  his  polished  desk      
Although  Bob  dressed  like  a  slob    he  kept  a  neat  office      
  Okay    what  happened          
  About  nine  this  morning  Mrs  Buck  phones  me  shes  having  trouble  with  one  of  her  farm  hands    money  trouble      
Colored  fellow  named  Tim  Williams    only  hand  she  has  working  for  her  now      
Tim  come  with  the  migratory  workers  that  follow  the  crops  up  from  the  South  last  year    but  Tim  and  his  wife  settled  here      
Never  had  no  trouble  with  him  before    thought  he  was  a  hard  worker    hustling  around  to  get  a  full  weeks  work      
Anyway    Julia  asks  me  to      
  Julia          
  Come  on    Inspector    look  alive      
Julia  Buck    the  deceased      Moore  said    slipping  me  his  smug    idiotgrin  again      
  Julia  asks  me  to  come  out  at  once      
But  she  didnt  sound  real  alarmed  you  know    like  there  was  any  immediate  danger      
I  got  there  at  947  AM    found  her  strangled      
I  would  have  come  sooner  if  Id  known      
No  doubt  about  Tim  being  the  killer    I  have  a  witness      
Dont  know  why  the  County  had  to  send  anybody  up  here      
Told  them  I  can  handle  this        
  Yeah    seems  you  have  a  nice  package    with  all  the  strings  tied      
Whos          
  Ill  collar  Tim  before  night        
  Whos  your  witness          
  Julia  had    has    an  old  Indian  woman  cooking  for  her    Nellie  Harris      
Probably  the  last  of  the  original  Island  Indians      
Nellie  was  in  the  kitchen    had  just  come  to  work    when  she  heard  Tim  arguing  with  Julia  in  the  living  room      
Swears  she  recognized  his  voice    that  Tim  yelled      Its  my  money  and  I  want  it          
And  then  rushed  out  of  the  house      
Then  she  heard  Julia  phone  me      
Nellie  went  on  with  her  house  work    until  I  found  Julia  dead      
And  before  you  say  it    Nellie  aint  near  strong  enough  to  have  strangled  Julia      
Theres  no  doubt  this  Tim  sneaked  back  and  killed  Mrs  Buck      
Another  fact    Tims  disappeared    on  the  run      
But  theres  no  way  off  the  Point  except  through  my  road  block      
Guess  you  want  to  see  the  body    have  her  up  the  street  in  Doc  Abels  office        
  Lets  see  it        
We  walked  up  Main  Street  to  this  big  white  house    then  around  to  the  back      
Being  the  Harbors  sole  doctor    Abel  was  also  its  Medical  Examiner      
The  corpse  was  on  a  table    covered  by  a  sheet      
Doc  Abel  was  busy  up  front  with  some  of  his  live  patients      
Pulling  back  the  sheet    I  examined  the  bruises  around  Julia  Bucks  once  slender  throat      
Powerful  hands  had  killed  her      
  Find  any  prints          
Chief  Moore  shook  his  big  head    seemed  lost  in  thought  as  he  stared  at  the  nude  body      
Then  he  said      Never  noticed  it  before  I  mean    when  she  was  dressed  but  for  a  woman  her  age    Julia  had  a  real  fine  figure        
I  dropped  the  sheet    glanced  at  my  watch      
It  was  almost  one  and  I  hadnt  had  lunch      
Still    I  wanted  to  get  this  over  with    had  a  lot  of  paper  work  waiting  in  my  own  office      
I  told  him      I  want  to  go  see  the  Buck  house        
  Sure        
Walking  back  down  Main  Street    I  said      I  saw  the  Harbors  one  squad  car  at  the  road  block    well  ride  out  in  my  car        
  Naw    well  use  mine      Moore  said    opening  the  door  of  a  sleek  white  Jaguar  roadster      
As  I  slid  in  beside  him  he  said      Some  heap    hey        
Got  a  heck  of  a  buy  on  this    dirt  cheap        
  Yeah    its  a  real  load      I  told  him    looking  up  the  street  at  my  battered  Ford      
Five  racing  minutes  later  we  pulled  into  the  driveway  of  this  typical  twostory  house    and  when  the  Jaguar  stopped  I  managed  to  swallow      
There  was  a  garage  and  a  modern  barn  in  the  rear    all  of  it  standing  between  two  large  flat  fields  planted  in  early  potatoes      
Everything  shouted  gentleman  farming    the  kind  of  grandfatherfathertoson  folding  money  the  Point  is  known  for      
The  fins  of  a  Caddy  were  sticking  out  of  the  garage    while  the  inside  of  the  house  was  a  comfortable  mixture  of  old  and  expensive  contemporary  furniture      
Nellie  Harris  wasnt  old    she  was  ancient    a  tiny  shriveled  woman  with  a  face  like  a  tan  prune      
She  was  also  stone  deaf  in  her  right  ear      
She  calmly  repeated  what  Moore  had  told  me      
When  I  asked      Why  didnt  you  go  into  the  living  room  to  see  how  Mrs  Buck  was          
The  old  gal  stared  at  me  with  her  hard  eyes    said      She  didnt  call      
I  do  the  living  room  last      
I  went  up  stairs  and  did  the  bath  and  her  bedroom    way  I  always  do  in  the  morning        
  Have  you  any  idea  what  this  Tim  and  Mrs  Buck  were  arguing  about          
  Probably  wages      
Miss  Julia  was  a  hard  woman  with  a  dollar      
Years  ago  when  I  asked  her  to  put  me  in  Social  Security    sos  I  wouldnt  have  to  be  working  now    Miss  Julia  threatened  to  fire  me    all  because  it  would  mean  a  few  more  dollars  a  year  to  her        
  Did  you  hear  Tim  return          
  No  sir      
Nobody  came  until  Chief  Moore        
I  drummed  on  the  kitchen  table  with  my  pencil      
  Mrs  Buck  have  any  men  friends          
  Her          
The  wrinkled  mouth  laughed    revealing  astonishingly  strong    white    teeth      
  I  never  see  none      
But  then  I  wasnt  her  social  secretary        
  Was  she  on  friendly  terms  with  other  members  of  her  family          
  Didnt  have  no  family    around  here      
They  had  a  son    killed  in  the  war        
I  walked  into  the  living  room      
There  didnt  seem  to  be  any  signs  of  a  struggle      
I  told  Moore      Where  does  Tims  wife  live          
  Ill  take  you  there      
Look  Jed    this  is  an  open  and  shut  case  and  I  have  to  relieve  my  men  at  the  road  block  soon      
Okay    come  on        
We  did  80  miles  an  hour  across  a  hard  dirt  road  to  a  cluster  of  shacks      
In  late  summer  migratory  workers  lived  five  and  six  to  a  room  in  these      
Now  they  were  empty    except  for  a  cottage  across  the  road      
Mrs  Tim  Williams  was  about  21    with  skin  the  color  of  bitter  chocolate    and  if  you  discounted  the  plain  dress  and  worn  slippers    she  was  startlingly  pretty      
The  inside  of  their  place  was  full  of  new  furniture    five  bucks  down  and  a  buck  a  week  stuff    but  all  of  it  clean  and  full  of  the  warmth  of  a  home      
Mrs  Williams  was  both  sullen  and  frightened      
She  said  she  didnt  know  a  thing    Tim  had  left  the  house  at  six  in  the  morning    as  usual      
She  hadnt  seen  him  since      
  Did  Mrs  Buck  owe  him  any  wages          
I  asked      
  Well    for  this  week    but  they  wasnt  due  till  Saturday      
Listen    Mr  Inspector    no  matter  what  anybody  say    my  Tim  didnt  kill  that  woman        
Tim  is  a  good  man    hard  working      
He  strong  as  a  bull  but  gentle  as  a  baby      
Even  if  he  angry    Tim  wouldnt  hurt  a  woman      
He  never  in  his  life  took  a  hand  to  a  woman  or      
  Well  get  him  soon    see  what  he  says      Chief  Moore  cut  in      
  Does  your  husband  have  a  car          
I  asked      
  Got  us  an  old  station  wagon      
Need  it  for  the  job        
I  asked  a  silly  question      Youve  no  idea  where  your  husband  could  be    now          
She  shook  her  head      
I  knew  she  was  lying      
I  stood  there    staring  at  her  for  a  moment    thinking  mostly  of  her  beauty  and  her  poverty      
Moore  said      Come  on    Jed    I  have  to  get  to  my  men        
On  my  way  out  I  told  her      If  you  should  eh  just  happen  to  see  your  husband    get  him  to  give  himself  up      
Hell  get  a  fair  trial      
Hiding  out  like  this  wont  get  him  anything    except  more  trouble    or  a  bullet        
  Yes      
Ill  tell  him    if  I  see  him        
We  made  it  back  to  the  Harbor  in  less  than  four  minutes      
I  tried  not  to  act  scared      
That  Jaguar  could  really  barrel  along      
I  told  Moore  I  was  going  to  eat    get  some  forms  filled  out  by  Doc  Abel      
Chief  Moore  said      If  I  dont  see  you  when  I  return    see  you  for  certain  at  my  road  block    Inspector        
I  had  a  bowl  of  decent  chowder    phoned  the  Doc  and  he  said  hed  leave  the  death  statements  with  his  girl    in  a  half  hour      
Lighting  my  pipe    I  took  a  walk      
The  Harbor  is  a  big  yachting  basin  in  the  summer      
Even  now    there  were  several  slick  cruisers  tied  to  the  dock    an  oceangoing  yawl  anchored  inside  the  breakwater      
There  was  a  34  foot  Wheeler  with  Chief  Bobs  in  big  gold  letters  on  its  stern  also  tied  up  at  the  dock      
It  wasnt  a  new  boat    about  five  years  old    but  fitted  with  fishing  outriggers  and  chairs      
I  asked  an  old  guy  running  a  fishing  station  if  the  boat  was  Moores      
He  said      You  bet      
Bob  Moore  is  plumb  crazy  about  blue  fishing        
I  dropped  into  the  doctors  office    picked  up  my  forms      
As  I  was  walking  back  to  the  Police  Station    which  was  in  the  same  building  with  the  City  Hall  and  Post  Office    I  saw  Mrs  Tim  Williams  sneaking  into  the  back  of  my  car      
If  she  moved  gracefully    she  was  clumsy  at  it      
I  got  into  the  front  seat      
She  was    hiding    on  the  floor  of  the  back  seat    the  soft  curves  of  her  back  and  hips    rousing  lines      
I  drove  out  of  the  Harbor    turned  off  into  a  dirt  road  among  the  scrub  pine  trees  and  stopped      
I  waited  a  few  minutes  and  she  sat  up      
For  another  moment  we  didnt  talk    then  she  began  to  weep      
She  mumbled      I  just  know  that  Chief  Moore  is  out  to  kill  my  Tim          
  Maybe      
I  never  saw  him  so  anxious  before      I  said    lighting  my  pipe  and  offering  her  a  cigarette      
  Of  course    it  could  be  because  this  is  his  first  murder  case      
You  know  where  Tim  is    dont  you    Mrs  Williams          
She  puffed  on  the  cigarette  slowly    sitting  slumped  against  the  back  seat        
didnt  answer      
But  the  police  have  dropped  the  case      
I  want  you  to  go  to  Pearson  City  and  find  out  why    firsthand  stuff  for  your  modern  crime  series      
Take  the  same  train  Diana  Beauclerk  took  and  get  there  at  the  same  time      
Go  to  the  same  hotel  and  occupy  the  same  suite    1105        
  Will  the  hotel  rent  it  so  soon  after  the  crime          
  Why  not        
The  police  have  finished  with  it      
Besides    the  ber  of  the  suite  hasnt  been  published  in  any  newspaper      
To  the  hotel  people    youll  just  be  an  innocent  tourist  who  happens  to  ask  for  that  particular  suite        
  Still    they  may  not  want  to  rent  it        
  Thats  your  headache      
Once  inside    keep  your  eyes  open          
  For  what          
Alec  was  growing  more  and  more  skeptical      
  The  police  will  have  gone  over  every  square  inch  of  the  place  with  a  finetooth  comb      
The  hotel  people  will  have  scoured  and  vacuumed  it      
Ten  to  one    its  even  been  redecorated          
  Theres  always  a  chance  they  may  have  overlooked  something      returned  the  chief      
  Im  betting  on  that  chance      
Interview  the  bellboy  and  chambermaid  who  waited  on  Beauclerk      
Study  the  topography  of  the  suite      
Soak  up  local  color      
Reenact  everything  Beauclerk  did      
Try  to  imagine  youre  going  to  be  murdered  yourself    between  eleven  pm  and  one  am  the  night  you  arrive        
Alec  smirked      
  Cheerful  way  to  spend  an  evening          
A  sudden  thought  wiped  the  smirk  from  his  face      
  Suppose  the  murderer  should  return  to  the  scene  of  the  crime          
The  chiefs  eyes  gleamed      
He  spoke  softly      
  That  is  exactly  what  Im  hoping  for      
After  all    the  murderer  is  still  at  large      
And  the  key  to  the  suite  is  still  missing        
On  the  train  Alec  refreshed  his  memory  of  the  Beauclerk  case  by  reading  teletype  flimsies    spotnews  stories  about  the  crime  sent  out  by  the  Pearson  City  Star    a  member  of  the  Syndicate  Press      
Diana  Beauclerk  was  a  secondrate  actress  living  in  New  York      
Two  weeks  ago  she  had  gone  west  to  Pearson  City      
Daniel  Forbes    her  divorced  husband    lived  there      
So  did  the  firm  of  lawyers  who  had  got  her  the  divorce    Kimball  and  Stacy      
She  reached  Pearson  City  at  nine  pm  and  went  straight  to  the  Hotel  Westmore      
She  telephoned  the  junior  partner  of  her  law  firm    Martin  Stacy    and  asked  him  to  call  at  her  hotel  that  evening      
At  the  time  of  her  divorce  Forbes  had  promised  to  pay  her  a  lump  sum  in  lieu  of  further  alimony  if  she  remarried      
According  to  Stacy    she  told  him  she  was  planning  to  remarry  and  she  wanted  him  to  ask  Forbes  for  the  lump  sum      
Stacy  replied  that  it  would  bankrupt  Forbes    who  had  just  sunk  all  his  money  in  a  real  estate  venture      
Stacy  said  he  left  her  suite  at  nine  fortyfive  pm      
She  was  in  good  health  and  spirits    but  still  ermined  to  get  the  money  from  Forbes      
No  one  saw  Stacy  leave      
No  other  visitor  inquired  for  her  that  evening      
Next  morning  she  was  found  dead  in  her  suite  with  a  bullet  from  a    
Colt  revolver  in  her  brain      
According  to  the  medical  examiner    she  was  shot  between  eleven  pm  and  one  am      
Her  door  was  locked  and  the  key  was  missing      
So  was  the  gun      
When  Alec  finished  reading  he  was  sure  that  either  Forbes  or  Stacy  had  killed  Diana  Beauclerk      
Forbes  had  motive  and  Stacy  had  opportunity      
Find  a  motive  for  Stacy  or  an  opportunity  for  Forbes  and  the  case  would  be  solved      
The  Hotel  Westmore  proved  to  be  one  of  the  older  hotels  in  Pearson  City    and  definitely  secondrate      
Alecs  first  impression  of  the  lobby  was  gloomy    Victorian  dignity    black  walnut  and  red  plush    a  black  and  white  tiled  floor    and  Persian  rugs      
He  studied  the  night  clerk  as  a  man  measures  an  ersary      
  Id  like  the  room  I  had  the  last  time        
  Certainly    sir        
The  clerk  was  young  and  limp    with  a  tired  smile      
  Do  you  recall  the  ber          
  It  was  1105        
The  clerks  smile  congealed      
  That  suite  is  taken        
Alecs  glance  went  to  a  chart  of  guest  names  and  room  bers  hanging  on  the  wall  behind  the  clerk      
Opposite  the  ber  1105  stood  one  word    Unoccupied      
The  clerks  glance  followed  Alecs      
  We  have  better  rooms  vacant  now      he  babbled      
  Larger  and  more  comfortable      
At  the  same  rate        
Alecs  face  was  dark    blunt    and  sulky      
He  always  looked  impertinent  and  he  could  look  dangerous      
He  was  looking  dangerous  now      
He  raised  his  voice      
  Anything  wrong  with  the  plumbing  in  1105          
There  was  a  sudden  stillness  in  the  lobby      
Two  women    who  had  been  chattering  like  parrots    were  struck  dumb      
A  man    lighting  a  match  for  his  cigar    paused  until  the  flame  burned  his  fingers      
Even  the  bellboys  on  their  bench  were  listening      
The  clerks  eyes  flickered      
  Of  course  not          
  Anybody  with  a  contagious  disease  been  in  there          
  No          
The  clerk  was  almost  hysterical      
  Its  just  that    well    1105  is  being  redecorated        
  I  dont  believe  it        
Alec  leaned  on  the  desk    holding  the  clerks  eyes  with  his      
  Suppose  you  tell  me  the  real  reason      he  drawled      
  There  might  be  a  story  in  it        
  Ststory          
  Im  with  the  Syndicated  Press    Feature  Service      
Either  I  get  the  story    or  I  get  the  suite        
It  was  blackmail  and  the  clerk  knew  it      
  There  is  no  story      he  piped  tremulously      
  Front        
Show  this  gentleman  to  1105          
The  stillness  persisted  as  Alec  followed  a  bellboy  across  the  lobby  to  the  elevator      
He  could  feel  eyes  on  his  back      
He  wished  it  had  not  been  necessary  to  ance  the  ber  of  his  suite  quite  so  publicly      
The  corridor  on  the  eleventh  floor  was  dimly  lighted  by  electric  globes  at  intervals  of  thirty  feet      
A  thick    crimson  carpet  muffled  every  footfall      
At  the  end  of  the  corridor  Alec  noticed  a  door  marked    Fire  Stairs      
It  was  a  neat  setup  for  murder      
The  bellboy  unlocked  a  white  door  bered  1105      
The  room  was  dark  but  a  neon  sign  flashed  and  faded  beyond  the  window      
A  few  snowflakes  sifted  down  through  that  theatrical  red  glow    languid  as  falling  feathers      
Hastily  the  boy  switched  on  a  ceiling  light      
The  room  looked  normal  and  even  commonplace      
There  was  no  hint  of  a  violent  struggle  now      
Deal  furniture  with  a  mahogany  finish  was  neatly  arranged  as  if  it  stood  in  the  window  of  a  department  store      
The  blue  rug  was  suspiciously  bright  and  new      
It  had  never  been  stained  with  blood      
Table  covers  and  towels  were  clean    ashtrays  empty  and  supplied  with  fresh  matches      
The  mirror  over  the  bureau  was  a  blank  eye    round  and  innocent      
Alec  played  the  part  of  an  innocent  tourist      
  Is  there  anything  wrong  with  this  room          
  Nno        
The  boy  dropped  his  eyes      
  Afraid  youll  lose  your  job  if  you  dont  keep  your  mouth  shut          
The  boy  raised  his  eyes      
  Listen    mister      
If  you  want  my  ice    pack  up  and  take  the  next  train  back  to  New  York        
  Were  you  on  duty  here  two  weeks  ago          
The  boy  hesitated      
Then      Im  not  talking      
But  I  wouldnt  spend  a  night  in  here  for  a  million  bucks          
He  was  in  a  hurry  to  get  out  of  the  room      
Alec  gave  him  a  tip  and  let  him  go      
Alone    Alec  examined  the  doors      
There  were  three    one  leading  to  a  bathroom    one  to  the  hall    and  one  to  the  room  next  door  which  was  immovable    locked  or  bolted  on  the  other  side      
Alec  locked  the  hall  door  and  put  the  key  with  his  watch  on  the  bedside  table      
It  was  just  quarter  of  nine      
As  he  ranged  his  belongings  on  the  bureau  he  noticed  a  film  of  white  dust  on  the  dark  surface  of  the  wood  beyond  the  linen  cover      
Not  gray  like  the  dust  that  collects  in  an  unused  room    but  white      
Women  didnt  use  white  face  powder  nowadays    he  recalled      
They  used  pink    tan    or  cream  powder      
Alec  glanced  into  the  bathroom      
Blood  in  the  bathtub  where  the  murderer  appears  to  have  washed  his  hands      
It  seemed  clean  now    but  Alec  decided  against  a  bath      
He  crawled  into  bed  and  switched  off  the  light      
In  the  darkness  he  could  see  the  rosy  reflection  of  the  neon  sign  on  the  wall  opposite  the  window      
It  winked  as  steadily  as  a  metronome    on    off    on    off      
In  less  than  five  minutes  Alec  was  asleep      
He  never  knew  just  what  woke  him      
Yet  suddenly  he  was  wideawake      
There  was  no  sound  and  apparently  no  movement  in  the  room  except  the  noiseless  pulsation  of  the  red  light  on  the  wall      
He  lay  still    listening  to  the  silence    watching  the  light      
Somewhere  in  the  city  a  big  clock  sounded  twelve  solemn  notes    midnight      
According  to  the  medical  examiner  she  was  shot  between  eleven  pm  and  one  am      
Alec  heard  a  faint  sound      
His  heart  seemed  to  swell  and  knock  against  the  wall  of  his  chest      
For  the  sound  was  inside  the  room      
He  let  his  eyelids  droop  and  breathed  heavily    feigning  sleep      
The  sound  was  coming  nearer      
A  monstrous  shadow  fell  across  the  illuminated  wall    distorted  and  indefinable      
When  the  neon  sign  faded  out    the  shadow  disappeared      
When  the  neon  sign  flashed  on    the  shadow  was  still  there      
It  stretched  to  an  impossible  height    climbing  the  wall  to  the  ceiling      
That  meant  that  something  between  the  light  and  its  reflection  on  the  wall  was  moving  closer  to  the  source  of  the  light    in  this  case    the  window      
Cautiously  Alec  tensed  his  muscles    ready  to  jump      
The  bedsprings  betrayed  him  with  a  creak      
The  shadow  vanished      
Someone  had  moved  beyond  the  range  of  the  light  from  the  window      
Abandoning  caution    Alec  leaped  out  of  bed  and  groped  for  the  light  switch      
Before  he  could  snap  it  on    a  stinging  blow  caught  him  in  the  ribs      
He  lashed  out  blindly  with  his  right      
There  was  a  thick    squashy  crack  of  fist  on  flesh      
Something  hard  grazed  his  knuckles      
He  put  everything  he  had  into  the  next  and  aimed  down  where  the  stomach  ought  to  be      
Rough  cloth  rasped  his  fist      
There  was  a  grunt    curiously  inarticulate    like  that  of  an  animal  in  pain      
Something  heavy  shook  the  floor  as  it  dropped      
Alec  waited  a  moment    on  guard      
Nothing  happened      
Again  he  groped  for  the  light  switch      
The  blue  rug  had  been  rolled  up  and  stacked  in  one  corner  of  the  room      
On  the  bare  floorboards  a  man  lay  face  down      
He  had  a  short    heavy    powerful  body      
Alec  turned  him  over  and  discovered  a  round    lumpy  face  with  narrow    slanting  eyes    a  primitive  Tartar  face  from  Russia  or  the  Balkans      
The  mans  shoes  were  too  pointed    his  overcoat  too  broad  at  the  shoulders  and  too  narrow  at  the  waist      
There  was  a  slight  bulge  under  the  left  armpit    a  shoulder  holster      
Alec  promptly  removed  the  gun      
He  was  familiar  with  this  type      
He  had  seen  it  in  the  lineup  at  Police  Headquarters  in  New  York    in  Broadway  night  clubs  and  Seventh  Avenue  pool  rooms    in  the  criminal  courts      
But  he  was  surprised  to  meet  it  here      
Diana  Beauclerk  had  no  connection  with  the  underworld      
A  professional  gunman  would  not  have  killed  her  with  a  weapon  of  such  small  caliber  as  a    
    
Nor  would  he  choose  a  respectable  hotel  as  the  scene  for  a  killing  when  it  would  be  so  much  safer  to  take  his  victim  for  a  oneway  ride  on  a  lonely  country  road      
The  mans  eyelids  fluttered      
He  opened  his  eyes      
  What  are  you  doing  here          
Demanded  Alec      
The  man  made  no  reply      
His  eyes  were  dazed      
His  lips  were  bruised  and  swollen  where  Alec  had  hit  him      
  Did  you  kill  Diana  Beauclerk          
Alec  expected  an  indignant  denial    but  there  was  no  response  at  all      
  Oh    come  on    snap  out  of  it        
Or  Ill  turn  you  over  to  the  police          
The  silence  was  getting  on  Alecs  nerves      
The  man  opened  his  mouth    but  no  words  came      
Only  that  curious    animal  grunting  Alec  had  heard  during  their  fight      
  Dont  you  speak  English          
The  man  opened  his  mouth  wider      
A  forefinger  pointed  toward  his  gullet      
Alec  leaned  forward  to  look      
There  were  hideous  scars  inside  the  throat  and  the  palate  was  mutilated      
In  good  time  I  shall  get  to  the  distressing  actuality    to  Red  McIver  and  Handley  Walker    to  murder  and  sudden  death      
But  you  realize    I  am  sure    how  much  old  deeds  incite  to  new  ones    and  you  must  forgive  me  if  I  tell  you  first  of  the  old  ones      
It  was  in  1814  that  Abraham  Wharf  and  his  sister  sat  by  a  meager  fire  in  their  house  on  Dogtown  Common    a  desolate  place  even  then      
He  was  sharpening  his  razor      
  Sister      said  he    do  you  think  people  who  commit  suicide  go  to  heaven          
And  she  answered      I  dont  know    but  I  hope  youll  never  do  such  a  thing        
Without  a  tremor      God  forbid          
He  said    and  went  out  and  cut  his  throat  in  the  cave  near  Granny  Days  swamp      
What  has  this  to  do  with  the  present        
Much    I  assure  you      
You  must  know  what  gets  into  people    even  such  as  Red  and  Handley    before  you  can  tell  what  comes  out  of  them      
They  had  learned    both  of  them    about  Abraham  Wharf      
Thats  why  I  beg  you  not  to  forget  him      
His  ghost  is  not  laid      
Red  and  Handley    God  help  them    knew  the  old  Dogtown  lore        
and  I  knew  they  knew  it    for  Id  told  them  a  lot  of  it      
And  isnt  it  true  that  you  get  a  deeper  perception  about  a  man  and  his  motives  when  you  know  what  it  is  he  knows        
Yes    gentlemen    I  am  getting  to  the  point    to  my  point      
You  know  the  facts        
they  are  set  forth  in  your  own  newspapers      
You  want  from  me  the  story    but  a  story  is  about    why    and  then    perhaps    about  how      
The    when    you  know        
yesterday  morning      
So  what  I  am  trying  to  tell  you  is  the    why      that  is  my  point    and  that  concerns  the  spirit  of  the  matter      
There  is  an  inwardness  and  a  luster  to  old  furniture  (  look  at  that  mahogany  highboy  behind  you  )  which  has  a  provocative  emanation    if  I  may  say  so      
Places    too    have  their  haunting  qualities      
Even  people      
And  my  point  in  this  sad  story  is  the  spirit  of  the  matter      
When  you  hold  the  spirit  of  a  thing    then  somehow  you  know  the  truth    you  know  a  fake  antique  from  the  real  thing      
And  the  truth  is  what  youve  come  for    is  it  not        
Now    Dogtown  is  one  of  those  places  that  creeps  into  the  marrow  as  worms  get  into  old  wood    under  the  veneer      
In  fact    all  the  folk  who  lived  on  the  back  of  Cape  Ann    they  are  not  just  like  others      
Theres  a  different  hallmark  on  them      
There  were  no  witch  burnings  here  because  everyone  had  a  witch  in  the  family      
Just  think  of  old  Granther  Stannard  who  pulled  the  teeth  of  Dark  Younger  (  her  real  name  was  Dorcas  )    and  because  he  bungled  the  job  and  left  two  protruding  tusks  she  put  such  a  hex  on  him  that  he  thought  his  legs  were  made  of  glass      
After  that  he  was  never  known  to  run  or  even  walk  fast      
Today  Dogtown  is  the  only  deserted  village  in  all  New  England  that  I  know  of      
There  it  sits    a  small  highland    with  towns  like  Gloucester  near  by        
but  now  its  the  most  lost  and  tortured  place  in  the  world      
Those  who  lived  in  that  desolation  of  rocky  deformity  took  on  some  of  the  moraines  stony  character      
Scientists  say  it  is  the  last  spewings  of  a  great  glacier    but  one  rather  feels  that  only  a  malevolent  giant  could  have  piled  up  those  crouching  monsters  of  granite  which  still  seem  to  preserve  a  sort  of  suspended    ominous  life  in  them      
Well  walk  up  there  later      
Its  perhaps  a  mile  from  here  where  we  sit      
And  not  one  single  dwelling  left  there    though  once    in  the  early  eighteenth  century    there  were  close  to  a  hundred  houses      
(  I  myself  have  identified  about  sixty  sites    from  the  old  maps  and  registers      
A  fascinating  pursuit    I  assure  you      
)  Even  I  can  remember  nothing  but  ruined  cellars  and  tumbled  pillars    and  nobody  has  lived  there  in  the  memory  of  any  living  man      
It  is  now  a  sweep  of  boulders  and  ledges    with  oak    walnut  and  sumac  creeping  across  the  common    and  everywhere  the  ruins  and  the  long    long  shadows      
Thats  your  setting    and  a  sinister  one      
Please  get  that  in  your  reports      
It  accounts  for  so  many  things      
Both  Red  McIver  and  Handley  Walker  lived  nearby    almost  as  near  as  I  do      
Red  lived  at  Lanesville    and  from  his  house  he  could  be  up  on  the  Common  in  a  half  hours  brisk  walk        
Handley  lived  further  on    at  Pigeon  Cove      
Id  often  find  one  or  other  of  them  up  around  Dogtown  sketching      
They  were  both  painters    (  They  were        
They  are        
What  should  one  say        
)  Well    anyhow    Dogtown  Common  is  so  much  off  the  beaten  track  nowadays  that  only  Sunday  picnickers  still  stray  up  there    from  time  to  time      
Searoad    railroad    lack  of  water    killed  Dogtown      
Dead    dead  as  a  brass  door  nail    and  I  sometimes  feel  like  the  Sexton    for  Im  about  the  last  to  be  even  interested      
I  knew  Red  and  Handley  well      
As  I  said    they  were  both  painters      
Theyd  come    separately    to  Gloucester  some  twenty  years  ago    theres  always  been  an  artists  colony  somewhere  on  Cape  Ann    and  each  married  here      
They  married  cousins    Anta  and  Freya  Norberg      
There  are  a  lot  of  Scandinavians  in  this  neck  of  the  woods    and  many  still  make  painted  furniture  and  take  steambaths      
Pretty  girls  among  them    with  blonde  hair  and  pert  faces      
Handley  married  Freya  and  Red    of  the  red  beard    married  Anta      
And  it  was  because  of  an  old  Norberg  inheritance  that  I  got  to  understand  them  all  so  well      
The  quarrel  ended  in  a  ridiculous  draw    but  I  must  tell  you  about  it      
Oh    yes    Im  quite  sure  its  important    because  of  the  Beech  Pasture      
Whats  that        
Why    thats  what  gave  me  the  feeling    gave  me  asitwere  the  spirit    the  demoniac    evil  spirit  of  this  whole  affair      
You  see    besides  being  custodian  of  antiquities    I  am  also  registrar      
No    I  dont  hold  with  those  who  live  entirely  among  dead  things      
I  know  as  well  as  the  next  man  that  a  ship  is  called  from  the  rigging  she  carries    where  the  live  wind  blows    and  not  from  the  hull      
But  youve  got  to  know  both      
Whats  below  the  waterline  interests  me  also      
As  I  was  saying    Ive  known  all  about  the  old  records    including  the  old  Norberg  deed      
Some  ten  years  ago  that  page  was  torn  out    I  dont  know  by  whom      
About  five  years  ago    Handley  came  to  ask  me  if  he  could  see  the  tattered  register      
He  was  courteous  and  casual  about  it    as  though  it  were  of  no  consequence      
Hes  always  like  that    in  spite  of  being  a  big  man      
(  When  you  see  him    youll  notice  his  habit  of  fingering    I  might  almost  say    stroking  a  large  mole  with  black  hairs  on  it    by  his  right  temple      
)  A  sensual  man    but  very  courteous    some  would  say  slick      
Like  his  glossy  black  hair      
Too  many  outside  manners    to  my  taste      
He  is  the  sort  who    with  an  appraising  eye    would  cross  the  street  to  help  a  strange  woman  on  to  a  bus  and  then  pinch  her      
A  real  gentleman    I  feel    would  do  neither      
Hes  always  worn  a  broadbrimmed  hat    and  Ive  noticed    in  my  small  study  at  the  Society    that  he  rather  smells  of  cosmetics      
The  next  week    cousin  Red  wandered  in  as  casually    but  curt  and  untidy      
Red  was  small  and  fineboned    like        
He  too  asked  to  see  the  same  page      
When  I  told  him  someone  had  torn  it  out    he  shouted      
  By  God    its  that  damn  Handley    the  sneak          
And  later  in  the  same  week  they  both  came  together  to  examine  the  register      
Fortunately  we  were  alone  in  the  building    so  few  people  nowadays  are  interested  even  in  their  own  past  or  in  the  lovely  craft  of  other  days    for  they  began  to  abuse  each  other  in  the  foulest  language      
Red  thrusting  out  his  tawny  beard    Handley  glowering  under  his  suddenly  rumpled  black  hair      
They  actually  bristled      
Le X rouge X et X le X noir X     
Violent  men  both      
Red  always  was  morose    yet  that  day  the  dapper  Handley  was  the  louder  of  the  two      
But  for  my  presence    they  would  have  been  at  each  others  throats      
During  the  quarrel  I  learned  what  the  trouble  was    from  the  accusations  each  hurled  at  the  other      
The  Beech  Pasture  had  suddenly  become  valuable      
Theres  a  fine  granite  quarry  there    and  granites  coming  back  for  public  buildings      
Both  men  knew  it  was  in  the  Norberg  family  holdings    but  to  which  of  the  cousins  did  it  belong    Anta  or  Freya        
Fortunately    I  knew  almost  exactly  what  the  will  had  said      
It  began  with  a  preamble    of  course      
This  explained  that  the  judge  of  probate  of  Essex  County    1785  or  1786    appointed  three  freeholders  of  Gloucester  to  divide  and  establish  the  Norberg  estate      
After  the  usual  Honorable  Sirs    it  went  on  to  say  that  there  had  been  set  off  to  the  widow  one  full  third  part  of  the  real  estate  of  the  deceased  Salu  Norberg    one  lower  room    on  the  Western  side    privileges  to  the  well  and  bakeoven  and  to  one  third  of  the  cellar  (  I  can  show  you  the  cellar  when  we  go  up  )    also  one  Cow  Right    and  lastly  they  set  off  to  the  widow  her  own  land  that  she  brought  with  her  as  dower    namely  the  Beech  Pasture      
And  I  remember  that  the  whole  of  the  privileges    not  counting  the  Beech  Pasture    was  valued  at  twenty  pounds      
I  wish  you  could  have  seen  the  crests  fall  on  these  two  sparring  coxcombs  when  I  told  them  that  obviously  the  pasture  belonged  to  their  wives  jointly      
That  battle  scene    ridiculous  as  it  was    remained  in  my  mind      
A  disturbing  picture  of  bad  blood    to  be  further  heightened  with  illicit  if  buccolic  colors    for  on  a  subsequent  day  I  saw  Handley  escorting  Anta    Reds  wife    up  on  Dogtown  Common      
I  felt  it  would  be  inopportune  to  disclose  my  presence      
Not  that  I  intentionally  go  unperceived    but  the  boulders  up  there  are  very  high  and  I  am  a  small  woman      
One  other  cause  of  jealousy  between  them  I  must  tell  you      
Paint        
Gloomy  and  unkempt  as  Red  McIver  was    he  was  much  the  better  painter      
I  suppose  Handley  knew  it      
If  Red  had  a  show  at  Gloucester    Handley  would  hurry  to  hang  his  pictures  in  Rockport      
You  may  say  this  has  little  pertinence    but    gentlemen    remember  that  all  this  prepared  my  mind    alerted  my  intelligence      
By  such  touches  the  pattern  takes  shape      
You  would  call  these  the  motives  of  crime      
I  would  call  them  the  patterns  of  life    perhaps  even  the  designs  of  destiny      
Yet  with  all  this  knowledge  I  had  nothing  of  substance  to  unravel  our  case    as  you  would  call  it    till  yesterday      
One  month  ago    on  the  20th  of  October    was  the  opening  of  the  gunning  season  in  Massachusetts      
Not  much  to  shoot    but  there  are  a  few  pheasant      
Rabbits    too    if  you  care  for  them    which  most  of  the  folk  around  here  havent  the  sense  to  appreciate      
Any  more  than  they  have  the  sense  to  eat  mussels      
That  was  the  day  Red  was  said  to  have  gone  away      
Oh  yes    hed  talked  about  doing  so      
In  fact    he  often  disappeared    from  time  to  time      off  to  paint  the  sea    aboard  a  dragger  out  from  Gloucester      
Anta    his  wife    never  seemed  to  mind      
I  suppose  these  absences  gave  her  more  clearance  for  her  embraces  with  Cousin  Handley      
Anyhow    I  wasnt  surprised    early  that  morning    to  see  Handley  himself  crossing  from  Dogtown  Common  Road  to  the  Back  Road      
No    he  didnt  have  his  gun    which  he  should  have      
It  would  have  been  a  good  excuse  for  his  being  there  at  all      
I  myself  had  been  up  there  by  seven  oclock    after  mushrooms    since  thered  been  a  week  of  rain  which  had  stopped  early  that  morning  and  the  day  was  as  clear  as  Sandwich  glass      
Thats  what  the  man  had  said      
Haney  peered  doubtfully  at  his  drinking  companion  through  bleary    tearfilled  eyes      
He  had  no  ready  answer    as  much  from  surprise  as  from  the  fit  of  coughing      
Was  the  man  drunk  or  crazy  or  both        
But  his  newfound  buddy  had  matched  him  drink  for  drink  until  he  lost  count    and  the  mans  eyes  were  still  clear      
The  guy  is  off  his  rocker    Haney  thought  to  himself    and  looked  away  from  those  eyes      
Eyes  that  were  clear    but  also  bright  with  a  strange  intensity    a  sort  of  cold  fire  burning  behind  them      
Why  hadnt  he  noticed  it  before        
No    the  man  was  not  drunk    
He  wondered  how  he  got  tied  up  with  this  stranger      
But    of  course    he  remembered  now      
It  was  blurred    after  two  hours  of  steady  drinking    but  the  occasion  of  it  came  back  to  him      
The  stranger    his  head  seemingly  sunk  in  thought    started  to  cross  the  street  against  the  light  just  as  a  huge  moving  van  roared  through  the  intersection      
Brakes  howled  and  a  horn  blared  furiously    but  the  man  would  have  been  hit  if  Phil  hadnt  called  out  to  him  a  second  before      
His  shout  had  been  involuntary    something  anybody  might  have  done  without  thinking    on  the  spur  of  the  moment      
As  a  matter  of  fact    he  wouldnt  have  cared  at  all  if  the  guy  had  been  hit      
Actually    he  regretted  having  opened  his  mouth  when  the  truck  came  to  a  stop  and  the  angry  driver  jumped  down  from  the  cab  and  walked  back  toward  them      
By  then    the  stranger  was  thanking  Haney  profusely  and  had  one  arm  around  his  shoulders  as  if  he  were  an  old  friend      
So  the  driver  started  to  curse  at  both  of  them  as  if  they  had  been  in  a  plot  together  to  ruin  his  safedriving  record      
Then  the  man  he  saved  turned  and  looked  squarely  into  the  truck  drivers  face    without  saying  a  word      
Very  suddenly    the  driver  stopped  swearing  at  them    turned  on  his  heel  and  went  back  to  his  truck      
Haney  hadnt  given  it  much  thought  at  the  time      
Now  he  recalled  it  very  clearly    and  wondered  what  the  truck  driver  had  seen  in  those  eyes  to  make  him  back  off      
It  must  have  been  the  sort  of  look  that  can  call  a  bluff  without  saying  a  word      
When  the  light  went  their  way    they  went  on  across  the  street      
And  when  the  stranger  found  out  that  Phil  was  on  the  way  to  one  of  his  favorite  bars    he  insisted  on  offering  to  buy  drinks  for  both  of  them      
Phil  usually  went  alone  and  kept  to  himself    sitting  in  a  corner  and  passing  the  time  by  nursing  his  favorite  grudges      
But  he  decided  he  wouldnt  mind  company  in  return  for  free  drinks    even  though  he  made  good  money  at  his  job      
Phil  was  like  that      
Now  he  wondered  if  it  was  worth  it    having  a  screwball  for  company      
He  really  didnt  take  the  offer  seriously    but  he  began  to  feel  uneasy      
When  he  finally  got  the  coughing  under  control    he  realized  that  Pete  (  all  he  gave  was  his  first  name  )  was  still  waiting  for  an  answer    he  didnt  even  seem  to  wink  as  he  continued  to  stare      
Haney  managed  a  weak  laugh      
  Guess  I  cant  think  of  anyone    Pete      
Thanks  anyhow        
A  faint  crease  appeared  between  the  mans  eyebrows      
  I  think  you  arent  taking  me  seriously    Phil      
I  meant  it      
And  everybody  has  some  kind  of  grudge      
I  might  have  got  hit  by  that  truck  if  it  wasnt  for  you      
I  believe  in  returning  favors      
Ill  do  anything  for  somebody  I  like      
It  wont  cost  you  a  cent    Phil      
Go  ahead  and  try  me          
Phil  rubbed  his  forehead  wearily      
He  was  beginning  to  feel  woolly      
Maybe  it  would  be  better  to  humor  the  guy  and  then  make  an  exit      
He  really  didnt  expect  anything  to  come  of  it    and  there  were  a  few  people    
  All  right      he  conceded  finally      if  you  must  know    I  dont  get  along  with  the  landlord      
He  keeps  riding  me  because  I  like  to  listen  to  the  radio  and  sing  while  Im  taking  a  bath      
He  says  the  neighbors  complain    but  I  dont  believe  it      
Why  dont  they  tell  me  themselves  if  it  bothers  them          
The  man  closed  his  eyes  and  nodded      
When  he  looked  up  again    he  seemed  almost  contented      
  Fine      
Give  me  your  address      
It  will  take  a  little  time      
I  want  to  study  your  landlords  habits  and  movements  first      
You  see    I  always  make  it  look  like  an  accident      
Maybe  suicide    if  it  looks  reasonable      
In  that  way  theres  no  trouble  for  the  customer        
Haneys  eyebrows  flew  up      
  Customer          
Pete  smiled  modestly      
  Its  my  line  of  work      he  said    
Five  minutes  later    before  Haney  could  make  his  break    the  stranger  stood  up  and  nodded  farewell      
Haney  watched  the  small  but  wiry  man  slip  out  the  door  quickly  and  silently    and  felt  relieved  to  see  that  nobody  else  seemed  to  notice  his  departure      
Phil  decided  to  stay  a  little  longer    and  as  time  passed  it  seemed  as  if  the  strange  little  man  had  never  been  there    but  for  the  other  glass  on  the  table      
Some  time  before  midnight  he  returned  to  his  apartment  and  hit  the  sack    putting  the  whole  incident  out  of  mind  before  he  fell  asleep      
The  next  day    Sunday    the  hangover  reminded  Haney  where  he  had  been  the  night  before      
The  hangover  in  turn  reminded  him  of  his  conversation  with  the  weirdy    and  he  groaned      
He  went  for  more  aspirin  later  in  the  day    and  passed  the  surly  landlord  on  the  way    he  was  still  alive  and  scowling  as  usual    as  if  tenants  were  a  burden  in  his  life      
Phil  shrugged  and  ignored  him      
He  went  back  to  work  Monday      
By  Wednesday  the  landlord  was  still  alive      
Of  course  On  Thursday    Haney  mailed  the  monthly  check  for  separate  maintenance  to  his  wife  Lolly    and  wished  the  stranger  could  do  something  about  her    
Coming  home  from  work    he  was  startled  to  see  a  police  car  parked  in  front  of  the  apartment  building      
Inside  the  lobby    people  were  standing  around    talking  excitedly      
His  spine  crawled  with  a  foreboding  premonition  as  he  asked  one  of  his  fellow  tenants  what  had  happened      
The  landlord  had  died      
Late  that  afternoon    it  seemed    he  had  fallen  off  the  roof  while  on  some  obscure  errand  or  inspection      
He  had  apparently  been  alone      
Nobody  witnessed  the  fall    just  the  sickening  impact  when  his  body  smashed  on  the  pavement  just  outside  the  basement  delivery  entrance      
Haney  hoped  that  nobody  noticed  his  sudden  pallor    as  he  felt  the  blood  drain  from  his  cheeks      
He  muttered  something  about  how  terrible  it  was    and  walked  with  deliberate  slowness  to  the  elevator      
Once  inside  his  apartment    he  poured  a  drink  with  trembling  hands  and  flopped  limply  in  a  chair      
After  a  while  he  began  to  feel  better  about  it    especially  when  no  one  bothered  to  ask  any  questions      
But  after  all    why  should  they        
Still  later    he  finally  convinced  himself  that  it  was  an  accident    just  a  coincidence      
The  stranger  really  had  nothing  to  do  with  it    of  course    
Haney  went  to  bed    happy  that  at  least  he  was  rid  of  that  lousy  landlord      
After  all    the  man  had  no  family    so  no  one  suffered    and  everybody  was  better  off  for  it      
Really    he  said  to  himself    nobody  kills  a  man  just  as  a  favor        
So  you  thought  I  didnt  mean  what  I  said      
The  strangers  eyes  were  large  and  sad    as  if  Phil  Haney  had  hurt  his  feelings      
It  was  like  a  recurrent    annoying  dream    but  now  the  dream  was  beginning  to  take  on  overtones  of  a  nightmare      
However    Haney  knew  it  was  not  a  dream      
He  might  be  very  tight    but  he  knew  where  he  was      
It  was  the  same  bar    and  it  was  two  weeks  later    Saturday  night    when  he  had  an  excuse  to  drink  heavier  than  usual      
He  had  been  sitting  in  the  usual  corner  at  the  little  table    as  far  as  possible  from  any  talkative    friendly  lushes      
He  was  enjoying  the  weekly  ritual  of  washing  down  his  pet  grievance  with  bourbon  slightly  moistened  with  water      
This  favorite  grievance  was  not  the  landlord      
He  had  already  quite  forgotten  about  him      
In  fact    he  had  only  mentioned  him  on  the  spur  of  the  moment      
His  real  grievance  was  Lolly      
Toward  the  end  of  his  fourth  hairy  highball    while  he  was  moodily  making  wet  rings  on  the  tabletop  with  the  bottom  of  the  glass    he  became  aware  that  he  was  not  alone      
He  looked  up  with  bloodshot  eyes  and  beheld  the  stranger  sitting  across  the  table    smiling  a  secret  smile  at  him    as  if  they  were  fellow  conspirators      
He  hadnt  even  noticed    what  was  his  name        
Pete        
  he  hadnt  seen  him  sit  down      
The  man  was  uncanny    like  a  shadow    and  made  as  much  noise  as  a  shadow      
Haney  felt  like  shrinking  out  of  sight    but  he  was  already  trapped  in  the  corner  with  the  wiry    dark  little  man      
He  began  to  wish  that  he  hadnt  shouted  that  other  evening  when  the  truck  bore  down  through  the  crossing      
Was  he  going  to  be  saddled  from  now  on  with  a  creep  for  a  barbuddy        
Hed  have  to  start  going  to  some  of  the  other  places  again      
In  a  low  voice    almost  whispering    the  man  had  asked  Phil  if  he  was  happy  with  the  way  the  landlord  had  been  taken  off  his  back      
He  made  the  mistake  of  answering  in  an  offhand  way    and  instantly  realized  that  his  skepticism  must  have  showed  in  his  face  or  voice      
Pete  frowned  slightly    then  became  sad  and  moody      
Haney  didnt  want  to  encourage  his  company    but  felt  he  ought  to  buy  him  a  drink  anyhow    to  prevent  possible  trouble      
But  there  was  no  trouble      
The  guy  sulked  over  his  drink    obviously  upset  by  Haneys  lack  of  appreciation      
To  break  the  uncomfortable  silence    Haney  began  to  talk      
In  time    and  two  drinks  later    he  was  complaining  bitterly  about  his  wife    He  was  on  the  subject  for  ten  minutes  or  so  when  he  noticed  the  renewed  interest  in  his  listener    it  showed  in  the  alert  face  and  the  suddenly  bright  eyes      
When  he  paused  to  moisten  his  throat    the  stranger  broke  in      
  But  why  pay  her  bills        
If  she  runs  around  with  other  men    and  if  you  hate  her  as  you  say    why  not  just  divorce  her          
Haney  scowled      
  That  bitch  would  love  a  divorce      he  growled      
  Then  shed  get  half  of  everything  I  have      
Community  property  deal    you  know      
Id  have  to  sell  out  my  business  to  pay  her  off  with  her  share      
She  can  drop  dead          
Pete  nodded  understandingly      
  Oh  yes      
Now  I  see      
You  must  understand    I  havent  been  in  this  state  too  long      
I  came  out  here  to  retire      
Thats  why  I    why  I  do  a  free  job  now  and  then      
You  should  have  told  me  about  her  before        
Haney  felt  a  twinge  of  annoyance  when  he  heard  the  now  familiar  line  again      
Then  a  wild  thought  ran  circles  through  his  clouded  brain      
Suppose    just  suppose  this  guy  was  really  what  he  said  he  was        
A  retired  professional  killer  If  he  was  just  a  nut    no  harm  was  done      
But  if  he  was  the  real  thing    he  could  do  something  about  Lolly      
He  felt  very  cunning    very  proud  of  himself  as  he  played  on  the  other  mans  soft  spot      
  No  offense  intended      he  said  gently      
  But  its  just  that    well    you  know      
The  cops  didnt  suspect  a  thing    and  I  thought  it  was  a  coincidence      
After  all    I  didnt  know  you    Pete      
It  could  have  been  an  accident        
He  shrugged  casually      
  But  if  you  say  you  managed  it    The  stranger  was  hooked      
His  eyes  burned  feverishly      
  Yes    yes      he  muttered  impatiently      
  Of  course  it  looked  like  an  accident      
I  always  work  it  that  way    and  always  at  a  time  when  the  customer  has  an  alibi      
Let  me  prove  it    Phil      
I  think  I  can  manage  one  more  favor  for  you        
He  waited  eagerly      
Haney  swished  the  liquor  in  the  bottom  of  his  glass      
About  halfway  back  Pops  groped  against  a  wall  and  stopped    pulled  away  two  loosely  nailed  wide  boards  at  one  end    and  went  through      
  Cmon      he  whispered        
  floor  levels  about  three  feet  down    so  dont  fall        
I  went  through  and  down    into  pitch  darkness      
He  said      Jist  stay  still      
Ill  pull  the  boards  back  and  then  get  us  a  light      
Jist  stay  where  you  are        
I  jist  stayed  where  I  was  while  he  fumbled  around  and  then  walked  away      
A  moment  later  he  struck  a  match  and  lighted  a  candle    and  I  could  see      
It  was  a  big  room    empty  except  for  a  few  things  of  Popss  at  the  far  end    a  wooden  crate  on  which  stood  the  candle    a  spread  out  blanket    and  an  unrolled  bindle      
I  looked  back  over  my  shoulder  while  I  went  to  join  him        
hed  hung  another  half  of  a  blanket  over  the  boarded  window  so  no  light  would  show  through      
I  took  the  pint  bottle  from  my  pocket  and  handed  it  over  as  I  sat  down  beside  him  on  the  spread  blanket      
  You  first      I  said      
He  drank  and  handed  it  back      
  Nice  place      I  told  him      
  Listen    I  got  a  buddy  I  travel  with    real  nice  guy  named  Larry      
I  know  where  he  is    right  near  here      
Could  he  join  the  party  and  sleep  here  tonight  too        
Well  both  be  blowing  town  tomorrow  so  we  wont  be  moving  in  on  you        
He  hesitated  a  second    looking  at  the  bottle    before  he  said    Suresure      and  I  reassured  him      
  Hell  bring  a  bottle  too    and  Ill  get  another  one  or  maybe  two  while  Im  out      
You  can  work  on  this  one  while  Im  gone    kill  it  if  you  want        
I  took  a  short  swallow  from  it  myself  and  handed  it  to  him      
His    suresure    was  enthusiastic  this  time      
He  put  the  bottle  down      
  Git  over  by  the  window  while  theres  light    an  Ill  put  th  candle  out      
When  yuh  come  back  Ill  put  it  out  agin  till  youre  both  inside        
Charlie  was  waiting    leaning  against  a  building  front      
  Perfect  setup      I  told  him      
  But  we  got  to  go  back  to  Fifth  and  get  another  bottle  or  two      
On  the  way  Ill  give  you  the  scoop        
On  the  way  I  gave  him  the  scoop      
I  bought  another  pint  of  sherry  and  when  we  got  back  Pops  let  us  in  in  the  dark    put  back  the  blanket  and  then  lighted  the  candle  again      
I  introduced  my  friend  Larry  to  Pops  and  we  made  ourselves  comfortable      
There  was  still  a  little    not  much    left  in  the  first  bottle  and  we  passed  it  around  once  and  killed  it    and  Charlie  opened  his      
I  was  reminded    amusedly    by  a  poem  of  Kenneth  Patchens  called  The  Murder  of  Two  Men  by  a  Young  Kid  Wearing  Lemon  Colored  Gloves    which  Patchen  himself  read  on  a  record  against  jazz  background      
The  poem  consisted  of  only  two  words    the  word    Wait      repeated  over  and  over  at  irregular  intervals  and  with  different  inflections    and  then  the  word    Now          
And  a  blaring  final  chord  from  the  jazz  group      
This  was  the  same    except  that  it  was  the  murder  of  one  man  by  two  men  and  neither  of  us  was  wearing  gloves      
But  we  could  wait  all  right        
there  was  no  hurry      
I  said      Wait  wait    to  Charlie  and  he  grinned    digging  the  reference      
Wed  heard  the  record  together  once      
The  second  bottle  passed  a  few  times      
Pops  was  taking  long  ones    but  not  showing  the  effect  yet      
He  seemed  as  drunk  as  when  Id  first  talked  to  him    but  no  drunker      
He  had  a  capacity        
if  wed  really  been  trying  to  get  him  dead  drunk  wed  have  had  to  go  out  for  more  wine      
About  halfway  through  the  second  bottle    Charlie  looked  at  me  across  Pops    who  was  sitting  between  us  and  asked    Now          
I  said      Wait      and  handed  the  bottle  to  Pops  for  his  final  drink      
When  he  handed  it  back  and  I  had  hold  of  it  safely    Pops  was  looking  toward  me  and  I  said    Now      to  Charlie  and  he  swung  the  short  length  of  lead  pipe  hed  meanwhile  taken  from  his  pocket    once      
It  was  a  lead  pipe  cinch      
There  was  a  sound  like  the  one  you  produce  by  flicking  a  watermelon  with  your  finger    only  louder    and  Pops  fell  forward  from  the  waist  and  then  over  sidewise      
Out  cold    if  not  dead        
and  hed  never  known  what  hit  him    hed  never  known  that  anything  had  hit  him      
I  reached  my  hand  toward  him  to  put  it  inside  his  shirt  to  feel  for  a  heartbeat    but  Charlie  said    Wait          
  and  said  it  sharply    not  as  in  the  Patchen  bit    but  as  an  order    so  I  stopped  my  hand  and  looked  at  him      
He  was  holding  the  piece  of  lead  pipe  out  to  me      
  We  dont  want  to  know  whether  hes  dead    yet      
I  gauged  that  blow  to  be  borderline      
To  kayo  him  and  maybe  or  maybe  not  kill      
You  hit  again  about  twice  that  hard  before  we  know  whether  hes  dead  or  not      
That  way  well  never  know  which  of  us  really  killed  him  and  which  was  just  the  accomplice      
Dig          
I  dug  him    I  saw  his  point        
it  made  sense      
I  took  the  piece  of  pipe  from  Charlies  hand  and  used  it    harder  than  he  had      
The  thunk  was  louder    anyway    and  I  thought  I  heard  bone  crack      
Charlie  said      Good  boy      
That  did  it    if  mine  didnt      
And  well  never  know  which      
All  right    now  Ill  give  you  a  hand        
We  straightened  Pops  up  and  I  made  sure  there  was  no  trace  of  a  heartbeat      
I  nodded  to  Charlie      
  Lets  put  him  down  again  the  way  he  was      
Its  a  more  natural  position        
We  did  that      
  How  do  you  feel          
Charlie  asked  me      
  Cool      I  told  him      
  What  do  you  feel          
  Nothing      
Well  maybe  Im  exaggerating      
It  was  a  kick    but  not  a  big  enough  one  for  me  to  want  to  take  the  chance  again    except  for  stakes      
But  lets  not  talk  about  it  abstractly  until  were  out  of  here      
Now    first  question    the  bottles      
Shall  we  take  them  all  with  us    or  leave  one          
  Take  them      I  said      
  If  we  left  one  wed  have  to  wipe  it  for  fingerprints      
Heres  the  picture  we  want  to  leave  for  the  fuzz    whenever  the  body  gets  found      
This  happened  in  the  middle  of  a  drinking  bout  with  another  bum      
If  theyd  been  working  on  a  bottle  or  a  jug  hed  have  taken  it  with  him        
  Right      
And  hed  have  taken  the  weapon  with  him  too    so  we  take  that      
Now      He  looked  around      
  Ive  been  careful  about  fingerprints      
How  about  you          
  Same      
There  are  the  boards  over  the  window    of  course    but  theyre  not  painted  and  too  rough  to  take  prints      
Same  goes  for  the  rough  cement  of  the  ledge      
Besides    I  doubt  if  the  cops  will  even  try  dusting      
They  find  dead  winos  every  day    maybe  they  wont  even  autopsy  him  for  the  cause  of  death        
  We  cant  take  a  chance  on  that      
Weve  got  to  assume  theyll  decide  he  was  murdered  and  weve  got  to  keep  the  picture  consistent      
Our  hypothetical  other  bum  who  killed  him  would  have  turned  out  his  pockets      
Lets  do  that        
We  did  that  and  found  a  dirty  handkerchief    some  matches  and  fourteen  cents  in  change      
We  took  the  matches    they  were  book  matches  and  once  theyd  been  touched  might  retain  fingerprints    and  the  change      
We  discussed  the  candle  and  decided  the  hypothetical  other  bum  would  have  left  it  burning  to  light  his  way  to  the  window  and  because  hed  have  no  reason  to  blow  it  out      
The  candle  had  been  stuck  on  a  tin  lid  so  it  wouldnt  set  fire  to  the  crate  when  it  guttered  out      
A  fire  wouldnt  have  mattered  except  that  it  would  cause  Pops  to  be  found  sooner      
He  might  not  be  found  for  days    even  weeks    otherwise      
We  went  once  more  over  every  point    then  triplechecked      
Being  picked  up  for  questioning  by  a  cop  on  the  way  out  seemed  to  be  the  only  possible  remaining  danger    and  we  werent  picked  up  by  a  cop      
In  fact    nobody  saw  us    cop  or  citizen      
Winsett  is  a  quiet  street  with  no  taverns  and  was  completely  deserted  at  that  hour      
Which    if  it  matters    was  one  AM      
Less  than  three  hours  ago  wed  decided    in  Maxine  Wellss  pad  on  Cosmo    to  commit  a  trial  murder      
It  had  gone  like  clockwork      
Almost  too  smoothly    I  found  myself  thinking    and  then  told  myself  that  was  ridiculous      
How  safe  is  too  safe        
Thinking  like  that  can  get  you  into  a  padded  pad      
An  hour  later  we  were  back  in  my  unpadded  pad    killing  what  had  been  left  of  the  second  pint      
We  decided  to  leave  the  third  one  intact  for  tomorrow      
Also  our  plans  for  me  to  commit  Charlies  murder  and  for  him  to  commit  mine      
But  we  were  really  going  to  do  it      
We  shook  hands  on  it      
We  planned  ahead  only  one  step    a  rendezvous  for  tomorrow  when  we  could  swap  notes      
Id  tell  him  everything  Id  learned  about  Seatons  habits  and  habitat    and  hed  tell  me  the  score  on  Radic      
We  made  the  date  for  two  oclock  in  the  afternoon  at  Maxine  Wellss  pad      
Charlie  would  get  there  early  because  he  had  the  key      
From  here  on  in    the  less  Charlie  and  I  were  seen  together  in  public    or  visited  one  anothers  rooms    the  better      
I  was  dead  tired  and  slept  soundly    as  far  as  I  know  dreamlessly      
We  met  at  Maxines  and  decided  we  were  set  to  stay  as  long  as  it  took    into  or  even  through  the  evening    to  talk  things  out      
Charlie  had  brought  food  and  wed  decided  on  no  drinks      
Id  brought  along  the  virgin  pint  from  last  night    but  we  were  going  to  kill  that  only  when  we  were  through  talking      
I  talked  first    telling  him  everything  I  knew  about  Seaton  and  his  house  and  domestic  arrangements      
I  drew  diagrams  and  floor  plans        
he  memorized  them  thoroughly  and  then  we  tore  them  into  tiny  pieces  and  flushed  them  down      
He  gave  me  equivalent  and  even  more  ailed  dope  on  Radic    including  diagrams    one  of  the  apartment  building  Radic  lived  in  and  one  of  the  apartment  itself      
Hed  been  there  several  times    back  when    while  he  and  Radic  had  been  friends    or  at  least  not  enemies      
It  didnt  take  us  as  long  as  wed  thought  it  might        
it  was  not  quite  six  oclock  when  we  finished  and  Charlie  said      Well    I  guess  thats  it      
Shall  we  flip  a  coin  to  see  which  of  us  goes  first        
Or  would  you  rather  deal  a  hand  of  showdown  poker  or  play  a  game  of  gin  rummy    or  what          
  Wait  a  minute    Charlie      I  said      
  One  thing  we  havent  discussed    expense  money      
Well  need  some  at  least    if  only  bus  fare  to  the  scene  of  the  crime      
And  if  youre  as  flat  broke  as  I  am    I  think  well  have  to  take  the  added  risk  of  knocking  over  a  filling  station  or  something  before  we  split  for  one  of  us  to  set  up  an  alibi  while  the  other  does  his  dirty  work        
He  sighed      
  All  right    Ill  come  clean      
Ive  got  a  little  stashed  for  a  rainy  day    and  I  guess  this  is  rainy  enough      
A  couple  of  hundred      
If  you  draw  the  short  straw  Ill  lend  you  some  bread    like  fifty  bucks    before  I  take  off  to  visit  my  sister  in  Frisco      
Then    after  Im  back    another  fifty  so  you  can  put  some  mileage  on  yourself  and  have  a  solid  alibi  somewhere  while  I  take  care  of  your  seat  cover  boy        
  Solid      I  said      
I  took  a  deep  breath    and  the  plunge      
  In  that  case    lets  not  draw      
Ill  go  to  bat  first      
Youd  have  to  wait  till  Seatons  back  from  Mexico  City  and  also  while  I  set  it  up  with  Doris  to  have  her  have  an  alibi  for  Dnight      
So  it  wouldnt  be  for  days  or  even  a  week  before  you  could  do  anything      
But  your  friend  Manny  can  go  any  time        
He  grinned  and  clapped  me  on  the  shoulder      
  I  was  hoping  youd  say  that    Willy      
But  I  wouldnt  have  suggested  it      
Well    in  that  case    I  take  off  tomorrow  morning  for  Frisco      
And    in  case    I  brought  the  money  with  me        
Now  that  he  knew  himself  to  be  self  he  was  free  to  grok  ever  closer  to  his  brothers    merge  without  let      
Selfs  integrity  was  and  is  and  ever  had  been      
Mike  stopped  to  cherish  all  his  brother  selves    the  many  threesfulfilled  on  Mars    corporate  and  discorporate    the  precious  few  on  Earth    the  unknown  powers  of  three  on  Earth  that  would  be  his  to  merge  with  and  cherish  now  that  at  last  long  waiting  he  grokked  and  cherished  himself      
Mike  remained  in  trance        
there  was  much  to  grok    loose  ends  to  puzzle  over  and  fit  into  his  growing    all  that  he  had  seen  and  heard  and  been  at  the  Archangel  Foster  Tabernacle  (  not  just  cusp  when  he  and  Digby  had  come  face  to  face  alone  )  why  Bishop  Senator  Boone  made  him  warily  uneasy    how  Miss  Dawn  Ardent  tasted  like  a  water  brother  when  she  was  not    the  smell  of  goodness  he  had  incompletely  grokked  in  the  jumping  up  and  down  and  wailing      
Jubals  conversations  coming  and  going    Jubals  words  troubled  him  most        
he  studied  them    compared  them  with  what  he  had  been  taught  as  a  nestling    struggling  to  bridge  between  languages    the  one  he  thought  with  and  the  one  he  was  learning  to  think  in      
The  word    church    which  turned  up  over  and  over  again  among  Jubals  words  gave  him  knotty  difficulty        
there  was  no  Martian  concept  to  match  it    unless  one  took    church    and    worship    and    God    and    congregation    and  many  other  words  and  equated  them  to  the  totality  of  the  only  world  he  had  known  during  growingwaiting  then  forced  the  concept  back  into  English  in  that  phrase  which  had  been  rejected  (  by  each  differently  )  by  Jubal    by  Mahmoud    by  Digby      
  Thou  art  God        
He  was  closer  to  understanding  it  in  English  now    although  it  could  never  have  the  inevitability  of  the  Martian  concept  it  stood  for      
In  his  mind  he  spoke  simultaneously  the  English  sentence  and  the  Martian  word  and  felt  closer  grokking      
Repeating  it  like  a  student  telling  himself  that  the  jewel  is  in  the  lotus  he  sank  into  nirvana      
Before  midnight  he  speeded  his  heart    resumed  normal  breathing    ran  down  his  check  list    uncurled  and  sat  up      
He  had  been  weary        
now  he  felt  light  and  gay  and  clearheaded    ready  for  the  many  actions  he  saw  spreading  out  before  him      
He  felt  a  puppyish  need  for  company  as  strong  as  his  earlier  necessity  for  quiet      
He  stepped  out  into  the  hall    was  delighted  to  encounter  a  water  brother      
  Hi          
  Oh      
Hello    Mike      
My    you  look  chipper        
  I  feel  fine        
Where  is  everybody          
  Asleep      
Ben  and  Stinky  went  home  an  hour  ago  and  people  started  going  to  bed        
  Oh        
Mike  felt  disappointed  that  Mahmoud  had  left        
he  wanted  to  explain  his  new  grokking      
  I  ought  to  be  asleep    too    but  I  felt  like  a  snack      
Are  you  hungry          
  Sure    Im  hungry          
  Come  on    theres  some  cold  chicken  and  well  see  what  else        
They  went  downstairs    loaded  a  tray  lavishly      
  Lets  take  it  outside      
Its  plenty  warm        
  A  fine  idea      Mike  agreed      
  Warm  enough  to  swim    real  Indian  summer      
Ill  switch  on  the  floods        
  Dont  bother      Mike  answered      
  Ill  carry  the  tray        
He  could  see  in  almost  total  darkness      
Jubal  said  that  his  nightsight  probably  came  from  the  conditions  in  which  he  had  grown  up    and  Mike  grokked  this  was  true  but  grokked  that  there  was  more  to  it        
his  foster  parents  had  taught  him  to  see      
As  for  the  night  being  warm    he  would  have  been  comfortable  naked  on  Mount  Everest  but  his  water  brothers  had  little  tolerance  for  changes  in  temperature  and  pressure        
he  was  considerate  of  their  weakness    once  he  learned  of  it      
But  he  was  looking  forward  to  snow    seeing  for  himself  that  each  tiny  crystal  of  the  water  of  life  was  a  unique  individual    as  he  had  read    walking  barefoot    rolling  in  it      
In  the  meantime  he  was  pleased  with  the  warm  night  and  the  still  more  pleasing  company  of  his  water  brother      
  Okay    take  the  tray      
Ill  switch  on  the  underwater  lights      
Thatll  be  plenty  to  eat  by        
  Fine        
Mike  liked  having  light  up  through  the  ripples        
it  was  a  goodness    beauty      
They  picnicked  by  the  pool    then  lay  back  on  the  grass  and  looked  at  stars      
  Mike    theres  Mars      
It  is  Mars    isnt  it        
Or  Antares          
  It  is  Mars        
  Mike        
What  are  they  doing  on  Mars          
He  hesitated        
the  question  was  too  wide  for  the  sparse  English  language      
  On  the  side  toward  the  horizon    the  southern  hemisphere    it  is  spring        
plants  are  being  taught  to  grow        
    Taught  to  grow            
He  hesitated      
  Larry  teaches  plants  to  grow      
I  have  helped  him      
But  my  people    Martians    I  mean        
I  now  grok  you  are  my  people    teach  plants  another  way      
In  the  other  hemisphere  it  is  growing  colder  and  nymphs    those  who  stayed  alive  through  the  summer    are  being  brought  into  nests  for  quickening  and  more  growing        
He  thought      
  Of  the  humans  we  left  at  the  equator    one  has  discorporated  and  the  others  are  sad        
Yes    I  heard  it  in  the  news        
Mike  had  not  heard  it        
he  had  not  known  it  until  asked      
  They  should  not  be  sad      
Mr  Booker  T  W  Jones  Food  Technician  First  Class  is  not  sad        
the  Old  Ones  have  cherished  him        
  You  knew  him          
  Yes      
He  had  his  own  face    dark  and  beautiful      
But  he  was  homesick        
  Oh    dear        
Mike  do  you  ever  get  homesick        
For  Mars          
  At  first  I  was  homesick      he  answered      
  I  was  lonely  always        
He  rolled  toward  her  and  took  her  in  his  arms      
  But  now  I  am  not  lonely      
I  grok  I  shall  never  be  lonely  again        
  Mike  darling      They  kissed    and  went  on  kissing      
Presently  his  water  brother  said  breathlessly      
  Oh    my        
That  was  almost  worse  than  the  first  time        
  You  are  all  right    my  brother          
  Yes      
Yes  indeed      
Kiss  me  again        
A  long  time  later    by  cosmic  clock    she  said      Mike        
Is  that    I  mean      Do  you  know          
  I  know      
It  is  for  growing  closer      
Now  we  grow  closer        
  Well  Ive  been  ready  a  long  time    goodness    we  all  have    but  never  mind    dear        
turn  just  a  little      
Ill  help        
As  they  merged    grokking  together    Mike  said  softly  and  triumphantly      Thou  art  God        
Her  answer  was  not  in  words      
Then    as  their  grokking  made  them  ever  closer  and  Mike  felt  himself  almost  ready  to  discorporate  her  voice  called  him  back      Oh        
Oh        
Thou  art  God          
  We  grok  God

On  Mars  humans  were  building  pressure  domes  for  the  male  and  female  party  that  would  arrive  by  next  ship      
This  went  faster  than  scheduled  as  the  Martians  were  helpful      
Part  of  the  time  saved  was  spent  on  a  preliminary  estimate  for  a  longdistance  plan  to  free  bound  oxygen  in  the  sands  of  Mars  to  make  the  planet  more  friendly  to  future  human  generations      
The  Old  Ones  neither  helped  nor  hindered  this  plan        
time  was  not  yet      
Their  meditations  were  approaching  a  violent  cusp  that  would  shape  Martian  art  for  many  millennia      
On  Earth  elections  continued  and  a  very  anced  poet  published  a  limited  edition  of  verse  consisting  entirely  of  punctuation  marks  and  spaces        
Time  magazine  reviewed  it  and  suggested  that  the  Federation  Assembly  Daily  Record  should  be  translated  into  the  medium      
A  colossal  campaign  opened  to  sell  more  sexual  organs  of  plants  and  Mrs  Joseph  (    Shadow  of  Greatness    )  Douglas  was  quoted  as  saying      I  would  no  more  sit  down  without  flowers  on  my  table  than  without  serviettes        
A  Tibetan  swami  from  Palermo    Sicily    anced  in  Beverly  Hills  a  newly  discovered    ancient  yoga  discipline  for  ripple  breathing  which  increased  both  pranha  and  cosmic  attraction  between  sexes      
His  chelas X were  required  to  assume  the  matsyendra X posture  dressed  in  handwoven  diapers  while  he  read  aloud  from  RigVeda  and  an  assistant  guru  examined  their  purses  in  another  room    nothing  was  stolen        
the  purpose  was  less  immediate      
The  President  of  the  United  States  proclaimed  the  first  Sunday  in  November  as    National  Grandmothers  Day    and  urged  America  to  say  it  with  flowers      
A  funeral  parlor  chain  was  indicted  for  pricecutting      
Fosterite  bishops    after  secret  conclave    anced  the  Churchs  second  Major  Miracle    Supreme  Bishop  Digby  had  been  translated  bodily  to  Heaven  and  spotpromoted  to  Archangel    ranking  withbutafter  Archangel  Foster      
The  glorious  news  had  been  held  up  pending  Heavenly  confirmation  of  the  elevation  of  a  new  Supreme  Bishop    Huey  Short    a  candidate  accepted  by  the  Boone  faction  after  lots  had  been  cast  repeatedly      
LUnita X and  Hoy X published  identical  denunciations  of  Shorts  elevation    lOsservatore X Romano X and  the  Christian  Science  Monitor  ignored  it    Times  of  India  snickered  at  it    and  the  Manchester  Guardian  simply  reported  it    the  Fosterites  in  England  were  few  but  extremely  militant      
Digby  was  not  pleased  with  his  promotion      
The  Man  from  Mars  had  interrupted  him  with  his  work  half  finished    and  that  stupid  jackass  Short  was  certain  to  louse  it  up      
Foster  listened  with  angelic  patience  until  Digby  ran  down    then  said      Listen    junior    youre  an  angel  now    so  forget  it      
Eternity  is  no  time  for  recriminations      
You  too  were  a  stupid  jackass  until  you  poisoned  me      
Afterwards  you  did  well  enough      
Now  that  Short  is  Supreme  Bishop  hell  do  all  right    he  cant  help  it      
Same  as  with  the  Popes      
Some  of  them  were  warts  until  they  got  promoted      
Check  with  one  of  them    go  ahead    theres  no  professional  jealousy  here        
Digby  calmed  down    but  made  one  request      
Foster  shook  his  halo      
  You  cant  touch  him      
You  shouldnt  have  tried  to      
Oh    you  can  submit  a  requisition  for  a  miracle  if  you  want  to  make  a  fool  of  yourself      
But    Im  telling  you    itll  be  turned  down    you  dont  understand  the  System  yet      
The  Martians  have  their  own  setup    different  from  ours    and  as  long  as  they  need  him    we  cant  touch  him      
They  run  their  show  their  way    the  Universe  has  variety    something  for  everybody    a  fact  you  field  workers  often  miss        
  You  mean  this  punk  can  brush  me  aside  and  Ive  got  to  hold  still  for  it          
  I  held  still  for  the  same  thing    didnt  I        
Im  helping  you  now    am  I  not        
Now  look    theres  work  to  be  done  and  lots  of  it      
The  Boss  wants  performance    not  gripes      
If  you  need  a  Day  off  to  calm  down    duck  over  to  the  Muslim  Paradise  and  take  it      
Otherwise    straighten  your  halo    square  your  wings    and  dig  in      
The  sooner  you  act  like  an  angel  the  quicker  youll  feel  angelic      
Get  Happy    junior          
Digby  heaved  a  deep  ethereal  sigh      
  Okay    Im  Happy      
Where  do  I  start          
Jubal  did  not  hear  of  Digbys  disappearance  when  it  was  anced    and    when  he  did    while  he  had  a  fleeting  suspicion    he  dismissed  it        
if  Mike  had  had  a  finger  in  it    he  had  gotten  away  with  it    and  what  happened  to  supreme  bishops  worried  Jubal  not  at  all  as  long  as  he  wasnt  bothered      
His  household  had  gone  through  an  upset      
Jubal  deduced  what  had  happened  but  did  not  know  with  whom    and  didnt  want  to  inquire      
Mike  was  of  legal  age  and  presumed  able  to  defend  himself  in  the  clinches      
Anyhow    it  was  high  time  the  boy  was  salted      
Jubal  couldnt  reconstruct  the  crime  from  the  way  the  girls  behaved  because  patterns  kept  shifting    ABC  vs  D    then  BCD  vs  A  or  AB  vs  CD    or  AD  vs  CB    through  all  ways  that  four  women  can  gang  up  on  each  other      
This  continued  most  of  the  week  following  that  illstarred  trip  to  church    during  which  period  Mike  stayed  in  his  room  and  usually  in  a  trance  so  deep  that  Jubal  would  have  proced  him  dead  had  he  not  seen  it  before      
Jubal  would  not  have  minded  it  if  service  had  not  gone  to  pieces      
The  girls  seemed  to  spend  half  their  time  tiptoeing  in    to  see  if  Mike  was  all  right    and  they  were  too  preoccupied  to  cook    much  less  be  secretaries      
Even  rocksteady  Anne    Hell    Anne  was  the  worst        
Absentminded    subject  to  unexplained  tears  Jubal  would  have  bet  his  life  that  if  Anne  were  to  witness  the  Second  Coming    she  would  memorize  date    time    personae    events    and  barometric  pressure  without  batting  her  calm  blue  eyes      
The  expense  and  time  involved  are  astronomical      
However    we  sent  a  third  vessel  out    a  much  smaller  and  faster  one  than  the  first  two      
We  have  learned  much  about  interstellar  drives  since  a  hundred  years  ago        
that  is  all  I  can  tell  you  about  them      
  But  the  third  ship  came  back  several  years  ago  and  reported      
  That  it  had  found  a  planet  on  which  human  beings  could  live  and  which  was  already  inhabited  by  sentient  beings          
Said  Hal    forgetting  in  his  enthusiasm  that  he  had  not  been  asked  to  speak      
Macneff  stopped  pacing  to  stare  at  Hal  with  his  pale  blue  eyes      
  How  did  you  know          
He  said  sharply      
  Forgive  me    Sandalphon      said  Hal      
  But  it  was  inevitable        
Did  not  the  Forerunner  predict  in  his  Time  and  the  World  Line  that  such  a  planet  would  be  found        
I  believe  it  was  on  page  573          
Macneff  smiled  and  said      I  am  glad  that  your  scriptural  lessons  have  left  such  an  impression        
How  could  they  not        
Thought  Hal      
Besides    they  were  not  the  only  impressions      
I  still  bear  scars  on  my  back  where  Pornsen    my  gapt    whipped  me  because  I  had  not  learned  my  lessons  well  enough      
He  was  a  good  impresser    that  Pornsen      
Was        
Is        
As  I  grew  older  and  was  promoted    so  was  he    always  where  I  was      
He  was  my  gapt  in  the  creche      
He  was  the  dormitory  gapt  when  I  went  to  college  and  thought  I  was  getting  away  from  him      
He  is  now  my  block  gapt      
He  is  the  one  responsible  for  my  getting  such  low  M  Rs      
Swiftly    came  the  revulsion    the  protest      
No    not  he    for  I    and  I  alone    am  responsible  for  whatever  happens  to  me      
If  I  get  a  low  M  R    I  do  so  because  I  want  it  that  way  or  my  dark  self  does      
If  I  die    I  die  because  I  willed  it  so      
So    forgive  me    Sigmen    for  the  contrarytoreality  thoughts        
  Please  pardon  me  again    Sandalphon      said  Hal      
  But  did  the  expedition  find  any  records  of  the  Forerunner  having  been  on  this  planet        
Perhaps    even    though  this  is  too  much  to  wish    find  the  Forerunner  himself          
  No      said  Macneff      
  Though  that  does  not  mean  that  there  may  not  be  such  records  there      
The  expedition  was  under  orders  to  make  a  swift  survey  of  conditions  and  then  to  return  to  Earth      
I  cant  tell  you  now  the  distance  in  lightyears  or  what  star  this  was    though  you  can  see  it  with  the  naked  eye  at  night  in  this  hemisphere      
If  you  volunteer    you  will  be  told  where  youre  going  after  the  ship  leaves      
And  it  leaves  very  soon        
  You  need  a  linguist          
Said  Hal      
  The  ship  is  huge      said  Macneff      but  the  ber  of  military  men  and  specialists  we  are  taking  limits  the  linguists  to  one      
We  have  considered  several  of  your  professionals  because  they  were  lamechians  and  above  suspicion      
Unfortunately      
Hal  waited    Macneff  paced  some  more    frowning      
Then    he  said      Unfortunately    only  one  lamechian  linguist  exists    and  he  is  too  old  for  this  expedition      
Therefore      
  A  thousand  pardons      said  Hal      
  But  I  have  just  thought  of  one  thing      
I  am  married        
  No  problem  at  all      said  Macneff      
  There  will  be  no  women  aboard  the  Gabriel      
And    if  a  man  is  married    he  will  automatically  be  given  a  divorce        
Hal  gasped    and  he  said      A  divorce          
Macneff  raised  his  hands  apologetically  and  said      You  are  horrified    of  course      
But    from  our  reading  of  the  Western  Talmud    we  Urielites  believe  that  the  Forerunner    knowing  this  situation  would  arise    made  reference  to  and  provision  for  divorce      
Its  inevitable  in  this  case    for  the  couple  will  be  separated  for    at  the  least    forty  years      
Naturally    he  couched  the  provision  in  obscure  language      
In  his  great  and  glorious  wisdom    he  knew  that  our  enemies  the  Israelites  must  not  be  able  to  read  therein  what  we  planned        
  I  volunteer      said  Hal      
  Tell  me  more    Sandalphon        
Six  months  later    Hal  Yarrow  stood  in  the  observation  dome  of  the  Gabriel  and  watched  the  ball  of  Earth  dwindle  above  him      
It  was  night  on  this  hemisphere    but  the  light  blazed  from  the  megalopolises  of  Australia    Japan    China    Southeast  Asia    India    Siberia      
Hal    the  linguist    saw  the  glittering  discs  and  necklaces  in  terms  of  the  languages  spoken  therein      
Australia    the  Philippine  Islands    Japan    and  northern  China  were  inhabited  by  those  members  of  the  Haijac  Union  that  spoke  American      
Southern  China    all  of  southeast  Asia    southern  India  and  Ceylon    these  states  of  the  Malay  Federation  spoke  Bazaar      
Siberia  spoke  Icelandic      
His  mind  turned  the  globe  swiftly  for  him    and  he  visualized  Africa    which  used  Swahili  south  of  the  Sahara  Sea      
All  around  the  Mediterranean  Sea    Asia  Minor    northern  India    and  Tibet    Hebrew  was  the  native  tongue      
In  southern  Europe    between  the  Israeli  Republics  and  the  Icelandicspeaking  peoples  of  northern  Europe    was  a  thin  but  long  stretch  of  territory  called  March      
This  was  no  mans  land    disputed  by  the  Haijac  Union  and  the  Israeli  Republic    a  potential  source  of  war  for  the  last  two  hundred  years      
Neither  nation  would  give  up  their  claim  on  it    yet  neither  wished  to  make  any  move  that  might  lead  to  a  second  Apocalyptic  War      
So    for  all  practical  purposes    it  was  an  independent  nation  and  by  now  had  its  own  organized  government  (  unrecognized  outside  its  own  borders  )      
Its  citizens  spoke  all  of  the  worlds  surviving  tongues    plus  a  new  one  called  Lingo    a  pidgin  whose  vocabulary  was  derived  from  the  other  six  and  whose  syntax  was  so  simple  it  could  be  contained  on  half  a  sheet  of  paper      
Hal  saw  in  his  mind  the  rest  of  Earth    Iceland    Greenland    the  Caribbean  Islands    and  the  eastern  half  of  South  America      
Here  the  peoples  spoke  the  tongue  of  Iceland  because  that  island  had  gotten  the  jump  on  the  HawaiianAmericans  who  were  busy  resettling  North  America  and  the  western  half  of  South  America  after  the  Apocalyptic  War      
Then  there  was  North  America    where  American  was  the  native  speech  of  all  except  the  twenty  descendants  of  FrenchCanadians  living  on  the  Hudson  Bay  Preserve      
Hal  knew  that  when  that  side  of  Earth  rotated  into  the  night  zone    Sigmen  City  would  blaze  out  into  space      
And    somewhere  in  that  enormous  light    was  his  apartment      
But  Mary  would  soon  no  longer  be  living  there    for  she  would  be  notified  in  a  few  days  that  her  husband  had  died  in  an  accident  while  on  a  flight  to  Tahiti      
She  would  weep  in  private    he  was  sure    for  she  loved  him  in  her  frigid  way    though  in  public  she  would  be  dryeyed      
Her  friends  and  professional  associates  would  sympathize  with  her    not  because  she  had  lost  a  beloved  husband    but  because  she  had  been  married  to  a  man  who  thought  unrealistically      
If  Hal  Yarrow  had  been  killed  in  a  crash    he  must  have  wanted  it  that  way      
There  was  no  such  thing  as  an    accident        
Somehow    all  the  other  passengers  (  also  supposed  to  have  died  in  this  web  of  elaborate  frauds  to  cover  up  the  disappearance  of  the  personnel  of  the  Gabriel  )  had  simultaneously    agreed    to  die      
And    therefore    being  in  disgrace    they  would  not  be  cremated  and  their  ashes  flung  to  the  winds  in  public  ceremony      
No    the  fish  could  eat  their  bodies  for  all  the  Sturch  cared      
Hal  felt  sorry  for  Mary        
he  had  a  time  keeping  the  tears  from  welling  to  his  own  eyes  as  he  stood  in  the  crowd  in  the  observation  dome      
Yet    he  told  himself    this  was  the  best  way      
He  and  Mary  would  no  longer  have  to  tear  and  rend  at  each  other        
their  mutual  torture  would  be  over      
Mary  was  free  to  marry  again    not  knowing  that  the  Sturch  had  secretly  given  her  a  divorce    thinking  that  death  had  dissolved  her  marriage      
She  would  have  a  year  in  which  to  make  up  her  mind    to  choose  a  mate  from  a  list  selected  by  her  gapt      
Perhaps    the  psychological  barriers  that  had  prevented  her  from  conceiving  Hals  child  would  no  longer  be  present      
Perhaps      
Hal  doubted  if  this  happy  event  would  occur      
Mary  was  as  frozen  below  the  navel  as  he      
No  matter  who  the  candidate  for  marriage  selected  by  the  gapt    
The  gapt      
Pornsen      
He  would  no  longer  have  to  see  that  fat  face    hear  that  whining  voice    
  Hal  Yarrow          
Said  the  whining  voice      
And    slowly    feeling  himself  icy  yet  burning    Hal  turned      
There  was  the  squat  loosejowled  man    smiling  lopsidedly  up  at  him      
  My  beloved  ward    my  perennial  gadfly      said  the  whining  voice      
  I  had  no  idea  that  you    too    would  be  on  this  glorious  voyage      
But  I  might  have  known        
We  seem  to  be  bound  by  love        
Sigmen  himself  must  have  foreseen  it      
Love  to  you    my  ward        
  Sigmen  love  you    too    my  guardian      said  Hal    choking      
  How  wonderful  to  see  your  cherished  self      
I  had  thought  we  would  never  again  speak  to  each  other        
5    
the  Gabriel  pointed  towards  her  destination  and    under  onegee  acceleration    began  to  build  up  towards  her  ultimate  velocity    991  percent  of  the  speed  of  light      
Meanwhile    all  the  personnel  except  those  few  needed  to  carry  out  the  performance  of  the  ship    went  into  the  suspensor      
Here  they  would  lie  in  suspended  animation  for  many  years      
Some  time  later    after  a  check  had  been  made  of  all  automatic  equipment    the  crew  would  join  the  others      
They  would  sleep  while  the  Gabriels  drive  would  increase  the  acceleration  to  a  point  which  the  unfrozen  bodies  of  the  personnel  could  not  have  endured      
Upon  reaching  the  desired  speed    the  automatic  equipment  would  cut  off  the  drive    and  the  silent  but  not  empty  vessel  would  hurl  towards  the  star  which  was  its  journeys  end      
Many  years  later    the  photoncounting  apparatus  in  the  nose  of  the  ship  would  ermine  that  the  star  was  close  enough  to  actuate  deceleration      
Again    a  force  too  strong  for  unfrozen  bodies  to  endure  would  be  applied      
Then    after  slowing  the  vessel  considerably    the  drive  would  ust  to  a  onegee  deceleration      
And  the  crew  would  be  automatically  brought  out  of  their  suspended  animation      
These  members  would  then  unthaw  the  rest  of  the  personnel      
And    in  the  halfyear  left  before  reaching  their  destination    the  men  would  carry  out  whatever  preparations  were  needed      
Hal  Yarrow  was  among  the  last  to  go  into  the  suspensor  and  among  the  first  to  come  out      
He  had  to  study  the  recordings  of  the  language  of  the  chief  nation  of  Ozagen    Siddo      
And    from  the  first    he  faced  a  difficult  task      
The  expedition  that  had  discovered  Ozagen  had  succeeded  in  correlating  two  thousand  Siddo  words  with  an  equal  ber  of  American  words      
The  description  of  the  Siddo  syntax  was  very  restricted      
And    as  Hal  found  out    obviously  mistaken  in  many  cases      
This  discovery  caused  Hal  anxiety      
His  duty  was  to  write  a  school  text  and  to  teach  the  entire  personnel  of  the  Gabriel  how  to  speak  Ozagen      
Yet    if  he  used  all  of  the  little  means  at  his  disposal    he  would  be  instructing  his  students  wrongly      
Moreover    even  getting  this  across  would  be  difficult      
For  one  thing    the  organs  of  speech  of  the  Ozagen  natives  differed  somewhat  from  Earthmens        
the  sounds  made  by  these  organs  were    therefore    dissimilar      
It  was  true  that  they  could  be  approximated    but  would  the  Ozagenians  understand  these  approximations        
Another  obstacle  was  the  grammatical  construction  of  Siddo      
Consider  the  tense  system      
Instead  of  inflecting  a    or  using  an  unattached  particle  to  indicate  the  past  or  future    Siddo  used  an  entirely  different  word      
Thus    the  masculine  animate  infinitive  dabhumaksanigaluahai X   meaning  to  live    was    in  the  perfect  tense    ksuupeliafo X   and    in  the  future    maiteipa X     
The  same  use  of  an  entirely  different  word  applied  for  all  the  other  tenses      
Plus  the  fact  that  Siddo  not  only  had  the  normal  (  to  Earthmen  )  three  genders  of  masculine    feminine    and  neuter    but  the  two  extra  of  inanimate  and  spiritual      
Fortunately    gender  was  inflected    though  the  expression  of  it  would  be  difficult  for  anybody  not  born  in  Siddo      
The  system  of  indicating  gender  varied  according  to  tense      
All  the  other  parts  of  speech    s    pros    ectives    ads    and  unctions  operated  under  the  same  system  as  the  s      
This  was  not    for  the  Angel    just  a  matter  of  running  through  a  logical  or  deductive  chain    or  deciding  on  some  action  from  some  already  established  premise      
No  doubt  the  Angels  could  do  that  kind  of  thing  as  fast  as  any  computer      
What  Gabriel  was  being  asked  to  do  now    however    was  to  reexamine  all  his  basic  assumptions    make  valuejudgments  on  them    and  give  them  new  and  different  powers  in  his  mind  to  govern  his  motives      
This  is  not  wholly  a  reasoning  process    a  computer  cannot  do  it  all    and  even  in  an  Angel  it  takes  time      
(  Or    perhaps    especially  in  an  Angel    whose  assumptions  had  mostly  been  fixed  millions  of  years  ago      
)    
Being  reasonably  sure  of  the  reason  for  the  long  pause    however    did  not  make  it  seem  any  less  long  to  Jack      
He  had  already  become  used  to  Hesperus  snapping  back  answers  to  questions  almost  before  Jack  could  get  them  asked      
There  was  nothing  he  could  do  but  wait      
The  dice  were  cast      
At  last  Gabriel  spoke      
  We  misjudged  you      he  said  slowly      
  We  had  concluded  that  no  race  as  ephemeral  as  yours  could  have  had  time  to  develop  a  sense  of  justice      
Of  course  we  have  before  us  the  example  of  the  great  races  at  the  galactic  center        
individually  they  are  nearly  as  mortal  as  you    the  difference  does  not  seem  very  marked  to  us    where  it  exists      
But  they  have  survived  for  long  periods  as  races    whereas  you  are  young      
We  shall  recommend  to  them  that  they  shorten  your  trial  period  by  half      
  For  now    it  is  clear  that  we  were  in  the  wrong      
You  may  reclaim  your  property    and  the  penalty  on  Hesperus  is  lifted      
Hesperus    you  may  speak        
  I  did  not  perceive  this  essential  distinction  either    FirstBorn      Hesperus  said  at  once      I  was  only  practicing  a  concept  that  Jack  taught  me    called  a  deal        
  Nevertheless    you  were  its  agent      
Jack    what  is  the  nature  of  this  concept          
  Its  a  kind  of  agreement  in  which  each  party  gives  something  to  the  other      Jack  said      
  We  regard  it  as  fair  only  when  each  party  feels  that  what  he  has  received  is  as  valuable    or  more  valuable    than  what  he  has  given        
His  heart    he  discovered    was  pounding      
  For  instance    Hesperus  agreed  to  help  me  find  my  property    and  I  agreed  to  take  him  to  Earth      
Between  individuals    this  process  is  called  bargaining      
When  it  is  done  between  races  or  nations    it  is  called  making  a  treaty      
And  the  major  part  of  my  mission  to  your  nest  is  to  make  a  treaty  between  your  race  and  mine      
Recovering  the  property  was  much  less  important        
  Strange      Gabriel  said      
  And  apparently  impossible      
Though  it  might  be  that  we  would  have  much  to  give  you    you  have  nothing  to  give  us        
  Hesperus  and  Lucifer      Jack  said      show  that  we  do        
Another  pause        
but  this  one  was  not  nearly  as  long      
  Then  it  is  a  matter  of  pleasure        
of  curiosity        
of  a  more  alive  time      
Yes    those  could  be  commodities  under  this  concept      
But  you  should  understand    Jack    that  Hesperus  and  Lucifer  are  not  long  out  of  the  nursery      
Visiting  the  Earth  would  not  be  an  offering  of  worth  to  those  of  us  who  are  older        
This  explained  a  great  deal      
  All  the  more  reason    then      Jack  said      why  we  must  have  a  treaty      
We  will  gladly  entertain  your  young  and  give  them  proper  living  quarters    in  return  for  their  help  in  running  our  fusion  reactors      
But  we  must  know  if  this  is  in  accordance  with  your  customs    and  must  have  your  agreement  they  will  not  misuse  the  power  we  put  in  their  hands    to  our  hurt        
  But  this  simply  requires  that  they  behave  in  accordance  with  the  dictates  of  their  own  natures    and  respect  yours  in  turn      
To  this  we  of  course  agree        
Jack  felt  a  wave  of  complete  elation    but  in  a  second  it  had  vanished  without  a  trace      
What  Gabriel  was  asking  was  that  mankind  forego  all  its  parochial  moral  judgments    and  contract  to  let  the  Angels  serve  on  Earth  as  it  is  in  Heaven  regardless  of  the  applicable  Earth  laws      
The  Angels  in  turn  would  exercise  similar  restraints  in  respect  for  the  natural  preferences  and  natures  of  the  Earthmen    but  they  had  no  faintest  notion  of  mans  perverse  habit  of  passing  and  enforcing  laws  which  were  contrary  to  his  own  preferences  and  violations  of  his  nature      
The  simple  treaty  principle  that  Gabriel  was  asking  him  to  ratify    in  short    was  nothing  less  than  total  trust      
Nothing  less  would  serve      
And  it  might  be    considering  the  uncomfortable  custom  the  Angels  had  of  thinking  of  everything  in  terms  of  absolutes    that  the  proposal  of  anything  less  might  well  amount  instead  to  something  like  a  declaration  of  war      
Furthermore    even  the  highly  trained  law  clerk  who  was  a  part  of  Jacks  total  makeup  could  not  understand  how  the  principle  could  ever  be  codified      
Almost  the  whole  experience  of  mankind  pointed  toward  suspicion    not  trust    as  the  safest  and  sanest  attitude  toward  all  outsiders      
Yet  there  was  some  precedent  for  it      
The  history  of  disarmament  agreements    for  instance    had  been  unreassuringly  dismal        
but  the  United  States  and  the  Union  of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  nevertheless  did  eventually  agree  on  an  atomic  bomb  test  ban    and  a  sort  of  provisional  acceptance  of  each  others  good  intentions  on  this  limited  question      
Out  of  that  agreement    though  not  by  any  easy  road    eventually  emerged  the  present  world  hegemony  of  the  United  Nations        
suspicion  between  member  states  still  existed    but  it  was  of  about  the  same  low  order  of  virulence  as  the  twentiethcentury  rivalry  between  Arizona  and  California  over  water  supplies      
Besides    agreements    in  principle      with  the  petty  ails  to  be  thrashed  out  later    were  commonplace  in  diplomatic  history      
The  trouble  with  them  was  that  they  almost  never  worked    and  in  fact  an  agreement    in  principle    historically  turned  out  to  be  a  sure  sign  that  neither  party  really  wanted  the  quarrel  settled      
Suppose  that  this  one  were  to  work        
There  was  no  question  in  Jacks  mind  of  the  good  faith  on  one  side    at  least      
If  mankind  could  be  convinced  of  that    
It  was  worth  trying      
In  fact    it  had  to  be  tried      
It  would  be  at  once  the  most  tentative  and  most  final  treaty  that  Earth  had  ever  signed      
Secretary  Hart  had  taught  Jack    at  least  partially    to  be  content  with  small  beginnings  in  all  diplomatic  matters        
but  there  was  no  small  way  to  handle  this  one      
He  turned  back  to  the  screens    the  crucial    conclusive  phrase  on  his  lips      
But  he  was  too  late      
He  had  lost  his  audience      
For  a  moment  he  could  make  no  sense  at  all  of  what  he  saw      
It  seemed  to  be  only  a  riot  of  color    light  and  meaningless  activity      
Gradually    he  realized  that  the  pentagon  of  Angel  elders  had  vanished    and  that  the  ritual  learning  dance  of  the  nursery  had  been  broken  up      
The  Angels  in  the  nursery  were  zigzagging  wildly  in  all  directions    seemingly  at  random      
  Hesperus        
Whats  going  on  here        
Whats  happened          
  Your  brothers  have  been  found      
They  are  on  their  way  here        
  Where        
I  dont  see  them      
The  instruments  dont  show  them        
  You  cant  see  them  yet    Jack      
Theyll  be  in  range  in  a  short  while        
Jack  scanned  the  skies    the  boards    and  the  skies  again      
Nothing      
No    there  was  a  tiny  pip  on  the  radar        
and  it  was  getting  bigger  rapidly      
If  that  was  the  skiff    it  was  making  unprecedented  speed      
Then  the  skiff  hove  into  sight    just  a  dot  of  light  at  first  against  the  roiling  blackness  and  crimson  streaks  of  the  Coal  Sack      
Through  the  telescope    Jack  could  see  that  both  spacesuits  were  still  attached  to  it      
The  sail  was  still  unfurled    though  there  were  a  good  many  holes  in  it    as  Langer  had  predicted  would  be  the  case  by  now      
It  was  a  startling    almost  enous  sight        
but  even  more  awesome  was  the  fact  that  it  was  trailing  an  enormous  cometstail  of  Angels      
The  skiff  was  not  heading  for  the  nursery    however      
It  seemed  unlikely  that  her  crew    if  either  of  them  were  alive    could  even  see  the  Ariadne    for  they  were  passing  her  at  a  distance  of  nearly  a  lightyear      
And  there  would  be  no  chance  of  signaling  them    without  the  Nernst  generator  Jack  could  not  send  a  call  powerful  enough  to  get  through  all  the  static    and  by  the  time  he  could  rebuild  his  fusion  power  the  skiff  would  be  gone      
Fuming    helpless    he  watched  them  pass  him      
The  sail    ragged  though  it  was    still  had  enough  surface  to  catch  some  of  the  ocean  of  power  being  poured  out  from  the  nursery  stars      
He  would  never  have  believed    without  seeing  it    that  the  bizarre  little  vessel  could  go  so  fast      
But  where  was  it  going        
And  why  was  it  causing  so  much  agitation  among  the  Angels    and  being  followed  by  so  many  of  them        
There  was  only  one  possible  answer    but  Jacks  horrified  mind  refused  to  believe  it  until  he  had  fed  the  radar  plots  of  the  skiffs  course  into  the  computer      
The  curve  on  the  card  the  computer  spat  back  at  him  couldnt  be  argued  with    however      
The  skiff  was  headed  for  the  very  center  of  the  nebula    toward  that  place  which    Jack  knew  now    could  hold  nothing  less  important  than  the  very  core  of  the  Angels  life  and  religion      
It  was  clear  that  Langer  had  at  last  found  a  way  to  attract  the  Angels  attention      
It  was  equally  clear  that  as  of  this  moment    the  treaty  was  off      
Stern  chase  10    
Langer  would  have  to  be  headed  off    whether  he  knew  where  he  was  going  or  not      
Almost  surely  he  did        
after  all    he  had  had  the  same  set  of  facts  as  Jack  had  had  to  work  from    and  he  was  an  almost  frighteningly  observant  man      
But  not  having  talked  to  the  Angels    he  had  made  a  wrong  turn  in  his  reasoning  somewhere  along  the  line      
Had  he  decided    perhaps    that  the  center  of  the  cloud  was  a  center  of  government    instead  of  a  center  of  life  and  faith          
But  it  didnt  matter  now  whether  he  meant  to  invade  the  Holy  of  Holies    or  was  simply  headed  in  that  direction  by  accident      
If  it  was  intentional    it  was  now  also  unnecessary        
and  whether  intentional  or  not    the  outcome  would  be  disastrous      
Jack  crawled  under  the  boards  and  restored  the  six  feet  of  lead  line  he  had  excised  from  the  Nernst  generator  switch      
When  he  was  back  on  his  feet  again  and  about  to  reinstall  the  fuses    however    he  hesitated      
He  had  to  have  fusion  power  to  catch  up  with  the  skiff    and  he  had  to  have  it  fast      
But  fusion  power  in  the  Coal  Sack  was  what  had  triggered  all  the  trouble  in  the  first  place    and  he  already  had  an  Angel  aboard      
  Hesperus          
  Receiving        
  Im  going  to  turn  my  generator  back  on    as  I  promised  to  do      
But  I  cant  take  you  to  Earth  yet      
First  Ive  got  to  intercept  my  brothers  before  they  get  any  deeper  into  trouble      
Will  you  obstruct  this    or  will  you  help        
I  know  its  not  part  of  the  bargain    and  your  elders  might  not  like  it        
  Nobody  else  can  live  in  your  hearth  while  I  am  in  it      Hesperus  said  promptly      
  As  for  my  elders    they  have  already  admitted  that  they  were  wrong      
If  because  of  this  incident  they  become  angry  with  Earth    I  will  not  be  permitted  to  go  there  at  all      
Therefore  of  course  I  will  help        
With  a  shortlived  sigh  of  relief    Jack  plugged  the  fuses  back  in  and  threw  the  switch      
Without  an  instants  transition    the  green  light  that  meant  full  fusion  power  winked  on  the  board      
Always  before    it  had  taken  five  minutes  to      
Of  course      
Hesperus  was  in  there      
From  here  on  out    the  Ariadne  was  going  to  be  hotter  than  any  space  cruiser  man  had  ever  dreamed  of      
But  since  he  had  failed  to  anticipate  it    he  lost  the  five  minutes  anyhow    in  plotting  an  intercept  orbit      
  Hesperus    dont  use  this  ttau  vector  trick  of  yours    please      
Ryan  hefted  his  bulk  up  and  supported  it  on  one  elbow      
He  rubbed  his  eyes  sleepily  with  one  huge  paw      
  Ekstrohm    Nogol    you  guys  okay          
  Nothing  wrong  with  me  that  couldnt  be  cured      Nogol  said      
He  didnt  say  what  would  cure  him        
he  had  been  explaining  all  during  the  trip  what  he  needed  to  make  him  feel  like  himself      
His  small  black  eyes  darted  inside  the  olive  oval  of  his  face      
  Ekstrohm          
Ryan  insisted      
  Okay        
  Well    lets  take  a  groundlevel  look  at  the  country  around  here        
The  facsiport  rolled  open  on  the  landscape      
A  range  of  bluffs  hugged  the  horizon    the  color  of  decaying  moss      
Above  them    the  sky  was  the  black  of  space    or  the  almost  equal  black  of  the  winter  sky  above  Minneapolis    seen  against  neonlit  snow      
That  cold    empty  sky  was  full  of  fire  and  light      
It  seemed  almost  a  magnification  of  the  Galaxy  itself    of  the  Milky  Way    blown  up  by  some  master  photographer      
This  fiery  swath  was  actually  only  a  belt  of  minor  planets    almost  like  the  asteroid  belt  in  the  original  Solar  System      
These  planets  were  much  bigger    nearly  all  capable  of  holding  an  atmosphere      
But  to  the  infuriation  of  scientists    for  no  known  reason  not  all  of  them  did      
This  would  be  the  fifth  mapping  expedition  to  the  planetoids  of  Yancy6  in  three  generations      
They  lay  months  away  from  the  nearest  Earth  star  by  jump  drive    and  no  one  knew  what  they  were  good  for    although  it  was  felt  that  they  would  probably  be  good  for  something  if  it  could  only  be  discovered    much  like  the  continent  of  Antarctica  in  ancient  history      
  How  can  a  planet  with  so  many  neighbors  be  so  lonely          
Ryan  asked      
He  was  the  captain    so  he  could  ask  questions  like  that      
  Some  can  be  lonely  in  a  crowd      Nogol  said  elaborately      
  What  will  we  need  outside    Ryan          
Ekstrohm  asked      
  No  helmets      the  captain  answered      
  We  can  breathe  out  there    all  right      
It  just  wont  be  easy      
This  old  world  lost  all  of  its  helium  and  trace  gases  long  ago      
Nitrogen  and  oxygen  are  about  it        
  Ryan    look  over  there      Nogol  said      
  Animals      
Ringing  the  ship      
Think  theyre  intelligent    maybe  hostile          
  I  think  theyre  dead      Ekstrohm  interjected  quietly      
  I  get  no  readings  from  them  at  all      
Sonic    electronic    galvanic    all  blank      
According  to  these  needles    theyre  stone  dead        
  Ekstrohm    you  and  I  will  have  a  look      Ryan  said      
  You  hold  down  the  fort    Nogol      
Take  it  easy        
  Easy      Nogol  confirmed      
  I  heard  a  story  once  about  a  rookie  who  got  excited  when  the  captain  stepped  outside  and  he  couldnt  get  an  encephalographic  reading  on  him      
Me    I  know  the  mind  of  an  officer  works  in  a  strange  and  unfathomable  manner        
  Im  not  worried  about  you  misreading  the  dials    Nogol    just  about  a  lug  like  you  reading  them  at  all      
Remember    when  the  little  hand  is  straight  up  thats  negative      
Positive  results  start  when  it  goes  towards  the  hand  you  use  to  make  your  mark        
  But  Im  ambidextrous        
Ryan  told  him  what  he  could  do  then      
Ekstrohm  smiled    and  followed  the  captain  through  the  airlock  with  only  a  glance  at  the  lapel  gauge  on  his  coverall      
The  strong  negative  field  his  suit  set  up  would  help  to  repel  bacteria  and  insects      
Actually    the  types  of  infection  that  could  attack  a  warmblooded  mammal  were  not  infinite    and  over  the  course  of  the  last  few  hundred  years  adequate  defenses  had  been  found  for  all  basic  categories      
He  wasnt  likely  to  come  down  with  hot  chills  and  puzzling  striped  fever      
They  ignored  the  ladder  down  to  the  planet  surface  and    with  only  a  glance  at  the  seismological  gauge  to  judge  surface  resistance    dropped  to  the  ground      
It  was  day    but  in  the  thin  atmosphere  contrasts  were  sharp  between  light  and  shadow      
They  walked  from  midnight  to  noon    noon  to  midnight    and  came  to  the  beast  sprawled  on  its  side      
Ekstrohm  nudged  it  with  a  boot      
  Hey    this  is  pretty  close  to  a  warthog        
  Uhhuh      Ryan  admitted      
  One  of  the  best  matches  Ive  ever  found      
Well    it  has  to  happen      
Statistical  average  and  all      
Still    it  sometimes  gives  you  a  creepy  feeling  to  find  a  rabbit  or  a  snapping  turtle  on  some  strange  world      
It  makes  you  wonder  if  this  exploration  business  isnt  all  some  big  joke    and  somebody  has  been  everywhere  before  you  even  started        
The  surveyor  looked  sidewise  at  the  captain      
The  big  man  seldom  gave  out  with  such  thoughts      
Ekstrohm  cleared  his  throat      
  What  shall  we  do  with  this  one        
Dissect  it          
Ryan  nudged  it  with  his  toe    following  Ekstrohms  example      
  I  dont  know    Stormy      
It  sure  as  hell  doesnt  look  like  any  dominant  intelligent  species  to  me      
No  hands    for  one  thing      
Of  course    thats  not  definite  proof        
  No    it  isnt      Ekstrohm  said      
  I  think  wed  better  let  it  lay  until  we  get  a  clearer  picture  of  the  ecological  setup  around  here      
In  the  meantime    we  might  be  thinking  on  the  problem  all  these  dead  beasts  represent      
What  killed  them          
  It  looks  like  we  did    when  we  made  blastdown        
  But  what  about  our  landing  was  lethal  to  the  creatures          
  Radiation          
Ekstrohm  suggested      
  The  planet  is  very  low  in  radiation  from  mineral  deposits    and  the  atmosphere  seems  to  shield  out  most  of  the  solar  output      
Any  little  dose  of  radiation  might  knock  off  these  critters        
  I  dont  know  about  that      
Maybe  it  would  work  the  other  way      
Maybe  because  they  have  had  virtually  no  radioactive  exposure  and  dont  have  any  Rs  stored  up    they  could  take  a  lot  without  harm        
  Then  maybe  it  was  the  shockwave  we  set  up      
Or  maybe  its  sheer  xenophobia      
They  curl  up  and  die  at  the  sight  of  something  strange  and  alien    like  a  spaceship        
  Maybe      the  captain  admitted      
  At  this  stage  of  the  game  anything  could  be  possible      
But  theres  one  possibility  I  particularly  dont  like        
  And  that  is          
  Suppose  it  was  not  us  that  killed  these  aliens      
Suppose  it  is  something  right  on  the  planet    native  to  it      
I  just  hope  it  doesnt  work  on  Earthmen  too      
These  critters  went  real  sudden        
Ekstrohm  lay  in  his  bunk  and  thought    the  camp  is  quiet      
The  Earthmen  made  camp  outside  the  spaceship      
There  was  no  reason  to  leave  the  comfortable  quarters  inside  the  ship    except  that    faced  with  a  possibility  of  sleeping  on  solid  ground    they  simply  had  to  get  out      
The  camp  was  a  cluster  of  alumi  bubbles    ringed  with  a  spy  web  to  alert  the  Earthmen  to  the  approach  of  any  being      
Each  man  had  a  bubble  to  himself    privacy  after  the  long  period  of  enforced  intimacy  on  board  the  ship      
Ekstrohm  lay  in  his  bunk  and  listened  to  the  sounds  of  the  night  on  Yancey6  138      
There  was  a  keening  of  wind    and  a  cracking  of  the  frozen  ground      
Insects  there  were  on  the  world    but  they  were  frozen  solid  during  the  night    only  to  revive  and  thaw  in  the  morning  sun      
The  bunk  he  lay  on  was  much  more  uncomfortable  than  the  acceleration  couches  on  board      
Yet  he  knew  the  others  were  sleeping  more  soundly    now  that  they  had  renewed  their  contact  with  the  matter  that  had  birthed  them  to  send  them  riding  high  vacuum      
Ekstrohm  was  not  asleep      
Now  there  could  be  an  end  to  pretending      
He  threw  off  the  light  blanket  and  swung  his  feet  off  the  bunk    to  the  floor      
Ekstrohm  stood  up      
There  was  no  longer  any  need  to  hide      
But  what  was  there  to  do        
What  had  changed  for  him        
He  no  longer  had  to  lie  in  his  bunk  all  night    his  eyes  closed    pretending  to  sleep      
In  privacy  he  could  walk  around    leave  the  light  on    read      
It  was  small  comfort  for  insomnia      
Ekstrohm  never  slept      
Some  doctors  had  informed  him  he  was  mistaken  about  this      
Actually    they  said    he  did  sleep    but  so  shortly  and  fitfully  that  he  forgot      
Others  admitted  he  was  absolutely  correct    he  never  slept      
His  body  processes  only  slowed  down  enough  for  him  to  dispell  fatigue  poisons      
Occasionally  he  fell  into  a  waking    grittyeyed  stupor        
but  he  never  slept      
Never  at  all      
Naturally    he  couldnt  let  his  shipmates  know  this      
Insomnia  would  ground  him  from  the  Exploration  Service    on  physiological  if  not  psychological  grounds      
He  had  to  hide  it      
Over  the  years    he  had  had  buddies  in  space  in  whom  he  thought  he  could  confide      
The  buddies  invariably  took  antage  of  him      
Since  he  couldnt  sleep  anyway    he  might  as  well  stand  their  watches  for  them  or  write  their  reports      
Where  the  hell  did  he  get  off  threatening  to  report  any  laxness  on  their  part  to  the  captain        
A  man  with  insomnia  had  better  avoid  bad  dreams  of  that  kind  if  he  knew  what  was  good  for  him      
Ekstrohm  had  to  hide  his  secret      
In  a  camp    instead  of  shipboard    hiding  the  secret  was  easier      
But  the  secret  itself  was  just  as  hard      
Ekstrohm  picked  up  a  lightweight  noback  from  the  ships  library    a  book  by  Bloch    the  famous  twentieth  century  expert  on  sex      
He  scanned  a  few  lines  on  the  social  repercussions  of  a  celebrated  nineteenth  century  sex  murderer    but  he  couldnt  seem  to  concentrate  on  the  weighty    pontifical    ponderous  style      
On  impulse    he  flipped  up  the  heat  control  on  his  coverall  and  slid  back  the  hatch  of  the  bubble      
Ekstrohm  walked  through  the  alien  glass  and  looked  up  at  the  unfamiliar  constellations    smelling  the  frozen  sterility  of  the  thin  air      
Behind  him    his  mates  stirred  without  waking      
Ekstrohm  was  startled  in  the  morning  by  a  banging  on  the  hatch  of  his  bubble      
It  took  him  a  few  seconds  to  put  his  thoughts  in  order    and  then  he  got  up  from  the  bunk  where  he  had  been  resting    sleeplessly      
The  angry  burntred  face  of  Ryan  greeted  him      
  Okay    Stormy    this  isnt  the  place  for  fun  and  games      
What  did  you  do  with  them          
  Do  with  what          
  The  dead  beasties      
All  the  dead  animals  laying  around  the  ship        
  What  are  you  talking  about    Ryan        
What  do  you  think  I  did  with  them          
  I  dont  know      
All  I  know  is  that  they  are  gone        
  Gone          
Ekstrohm  shouldered  his  way  outside  and  scanned  the  veldt      
There  was  no  ring  of  animal  corpses      
Nothing      
Nothing  but  wispy  grass  whipping  in  the  keen  breeze      
  Ill  be  damned      Ekstrohm  said      
  You  are  right  now    buddy      
ExPe  doesnt  like  anybody  mucking  up  primary  evidence        
  Where  do  you  get  off    Ryan          
Ekstrohm  demanded      
  Why  pick  me  for  your  patsy        
This  has  got  to  be  some  kind  of  local  phenomenon      
Why  accuse  a  shipmate  of  being  behind  this          
  Listen    Ekstrohm    I  want  to  give  you  the  benefit  of  every  doubt      
But  you  arent  exactly  the  model  of  a  surveyor    you  know      
Youve  been  riding  on  a  pink  ticket  for  six  years    you  know  that        
  No      Ekstrohm  said      No    I  didnt  know  that        
  Youve  been  hiding  things  from  me  and  Nogol  every  jump  weve  made  with  you      
Now  comes  this        
It  fits  the  pattern  of  secrecy  and  stealth  youve  been  involved  in        
  What  could  I  do  with  your  lousy  dead  bodies        
What  would  I  want  with  them          
  All  I  know  is  that  you  were  outside  the  bubbles  last  night    and  you  were  the  only  sentient  being  who  came  in  or  out  of  our  alarm  web      
The  tapes  show  that      
Now  all  the  bodies  are  missing    like  they  got  up  and  walked  away        
It  was  not  a  new  experience  to  Ekstrohm      
No      
Suspicion  wasnt  new  to  him  at  all      
  Ryan    there  are  other  explanations  for  the  disappearance  of  the  bodies      
Look  for  them    will  you        
I  give  you  my  word  Im  not  trying  to  pull  some  stupid  kind  of  joke    or  to  deliberately  foul  up  the  expedition      
Take  my  word    cant  you          
Ryan  shook  his  head      
  I  dont  think  I  can      
Theres  still  such  a  thing  as  mental  illness      
You  may  not  be  responsible        
Ekstrohm  scowled      
  Dont  try  anything  violent    Stormy      
I  outweigh  you  fifty  pounds  and  Im  fast  for  a  big  man        
  I  wasnt  planning  on  jumping  you      
Why  do  you  have  to  jump  me  the  first  time  something  goes  wrong        
She  lived  and  was  given  a  name      
Helva      
For  her  first  three  vegetable  months  she  waved  her  crabbed  claws    kicked  weakly  with  her  clubbed  feet  and  enjoyed  the  usual  routine  of  the  infant      
She  was  not  alone  for  there  were  three  other  such  children  in  the  big  citys  special  nursery      
Soon  they  all  were  removed  to  Central  Laboratory  School  where  their  delicate  transformation  began      
One  of  the  babies  died  in  the  initial  transferral  but  of  Helvas    class      seventeen  thrived  in  the  metal  shells      
Instead  of  kicking  feet    Helvas  neural  responses  started  her  wheels        
instead  of  grabbing  with  hands    she  manipulated  mechanical  extensions      
As  she  matured    more  and  more  neural  synapses  would  be  usted  to  operate  other  mechanisms  that  went  into  the  maintenance  and  running  of  a  space  ship      
For  Helva  was  destined  to  be  the    brain    half  of  a  scout  ship    partnered  with  a  man  or  a  woman    whichever  she  chose    as  the  mobile  half      
She  would  be  among  the  elite  of  her  kind      
Her  initial  intelligence  tests  registered  above  normal  and  her  adaptation  index  was  unusually  high      
As  long  as  her  development  within  her  shell  lived  up  to  expectations    and  there  were  no  sideeffects  from  the  pituitary  tinkering    Helva  would  live  a  rewarding    rich  and  unusual  life    a  far  cry  from  what  she  would  have  faced  as  an  ordinary      normal    being      
However    no  diagram  of  her  brain  patterns    no  early  IQ  tests  recorded  certain  essential  facts  about  Helva  that  Central  must  eventually  learn      
They  would  have  to  bide  their  official  time  and  see    trusting  that  the  massive  doses  of  shellpsychology  would  suffice  her    too    as  the  necessary  bulwark  against  her  unusual  confinement  and  the  pressures  of  her  profession      
A  ship  run  by  a  human  brain  could  not  run  rogue  or  insane  with  the  power  and  resources  Central  had  to  build  into  their  scout  ships      
Brain  ships  were    of  course    long  past  the  experimental  stages      
Most  babes  survived  the  techniques  of  pituitary  manipulation  that  kept  their  bodies  small    eliminating  the  necessity  of  transfers  from  smaller  to  larger  shells      
And  very    very  few  were  lost  when  the  final  connection  was  made  to  the  control  panels  of  ship  or  industrial  combine      
Shell  people  resembled  mature  dwarfs  in  size  whatever  their  natal  deformities  were    but  the  welloriented  brain  would  not  have  changed  places  with  the  most  perfect  body  in  the  Universe      
So    for  happy  years    Helva  scooted  around  in  her  shell  with  her  classmates    playing  such  games  as  Stall    PowerSeek    studying  her  lessons  in  trajectory    propulsion  techniques    computation    logistics    mental  hygiene    basic  alien  psychology    philology    space  history    law    traffic    codes    all  the  et X ceteras X that  eventually  became  compounded  into  a  reasoning    logical    informed  citizen      
Not  so  obvious  to  her    but  of  more  importance  to  her  teachers    Helva  ingested  the  precepts  of  her  conditioning  as  easily  as  she  absorbed  her  nutrient  fluid      
She  would  one  day  be  grateful  to  the  patient  drone  of  the  subconsciouslevel  instruction      
Helvas  civilization  was  not  without  busy    dogood  associations    exploring  possible  inhumanities  to  terrestrial  as  well  as  extraterrestrial  citizens      
One  such  group  got  all  incensed  over  shelled    children    when  Helva  was  just  turning  fourteen      
When  they  were  forced  to    Central  Worlds  shrugged  its  shoulders    arranged  a  tour  of  the  Laboratory  Schools  and  set  the  tour  off  to  a  big  start  by  showing  the  members  case  histories    complete  with  photographs      
Very  few  committees  ever  looked  past  the  first  few  photos      
Most  of  their  original  objections  about    shells    were  overridden  by  the  relief  that  these  hideous  (  to  them  )  bodies  were  mercifully  concealed      
Helvas  class  was  doing  Fine  Arts    a  selective  subject  in  her  crowded  program      
She  had  activated  one  of  her  microscopic  tools  which  she  would  later  use  for  minute  repairs  to  various  parts  of  her  control  panel      
Her  subject  was  large    a  copy  of  the  Last  Supper    and  her  canvas    small    the  head  of  a  tiny  screw      
She  had  tuned  her  sight  to  the  proper  degree      
As  she  worked  she  absentmindedly  crooned    producing  a  curious  sound      
Shell  people  used  their  own  vocal  cords  and  diaphragms  but  sound  issued  through  microphones  rather  than  mouths      
Helvas  hum  then  had  a  curious  vibrancy    a  warm    dulcet  quality  even  in  its  aimless  chromatic  wanderings      
  Why    what  a  lovely  voice  you  have      said  one  of  the  female  visitors      
Helva    looked    up  and  caught  a  fascinating  panorama  of  regular    dirty  craters  on  a  flaky  pink  surface      
Her  hum  became  a  gurgle  of  surprise      
She  instinctively  regulated  her    sight    until  the  skin  lost  its  cratered  look  and  the  pores  assumed  normal  proportions      
  Yes    we  have  quite  a  few  years  of  voice  training    madam      remarked  Helva  calmly      
  Vocal  peculiarities  often  become  excessively  irritating  during  prolonged  intrastellar  distances  and  must  be  eliminated      
I  enjoyed  my  lessons        
Although  this  was  the  first  time  that  Helva  had  seen  unshelled  people    she  took  this  experience  calmly      
Any  other  reaction  would  have  been  reported  instantly      
  I  meant  that  you  have  a  nice  singing  voice  dear      the  lady  amended      
  Thank  you      
Would  you  like  to  see  my  work          
Helva  asked    politely      
She  instinctively  sheered  away  from  personal  discussions  but  she  filed  the  comment  away  for  further  meditation      
  Work          
Asked  the  lady      
  I  am  currently  reproducing  the  Last  Supper  on  the  head  of  a  screw        
  No    I  say      the  lady  twittered      
Helva  turned  her  vision  back  to  magnification  and  surveyed  her  copy  critically      
  Of  course    some  of  my  color  values  do  not  match  the  old  Masters  and  the  perspective  is  faulty  but  I  believe  it  to  be  a  fair  copy        
The  ladys  eyes    unmagnified    bugged  out      
  Oh    I  forget      and  Helvas  voice  was  really  contrite      
If  she  could  have  blushed    she  would  have      
  You  people  dont  have  ustable  vision        
The  monitor  of  this  discourse  grinned  with  pride  and  amusement  as  Helvas  tone  indicated  pity  for  the  unfortunate      
  Here    this  will  help      suggested  Helva    substituting  a  magnifying  device  in  one  extension  and  holding  it  over  the  picture      
In  a  kind  of  shock    the  ladies  and  gentlemen  of  the  committee  bent  to  observe  the  incredibly  copied  and  brilliantly  executed  Last  Supper  on  the  head  of  a  screw      
  Well      remarked  one  gentleman  who  had  been  forced  to  accompany  his  wife      the  good  Lord  can  eat  where  angels  fear  to  tread        
  Are  you  referring    sir      asked  Helva  politely      to  the  Dark  Age  discussions  of  the  ber  of  angels  who  could  stand  on  the  head  of  a  pin          
  I  had  that  in  mind        
  If  you  substitute    atom    for    angel      the  problem  is  not  insoluble    given  the  metallic  content  of  the  pin  in  question        
  Which  you  are  programed  to  compute          
  Of  course        
  Did  they  remember  to  program  a  sense  of  humor    as  well    young  lady          
  We  are  directed  to  develop  a  sense  of  proportion    sir    which  contributes  the  same  effect        
The  good  man  chortled  appreciatively  and  decided  the  trip  was  worth  his  time      
If  the  investigation  committee  spent  months  digesting  the  thoughtful  food  served  them  at  the  Laboratory  School    they  left  Helva  with  a  morsel  as  well      
  Singing    as  applicable  to  herself  required  research      
She  had    of  course    been  exposed  to  and  enjoyed  a  music  appreciation  course  which  had  included  the  better  known  classical  works  such  as    Tristan  und X Isolde        Candide        Oklahoma        Nozze X de X Figaro      the  atomic  age  singers    Eileen  Farrell    Elvis  Presley  and  Geraldine  Todd    as  well  as  the  curious  rhythmic  progressions  of  the  Venusians    Capellan  visual  chromatics  and  the  sonic  concerti  of  the  Altairians      
But    singing    for  any  shell  person  posed  considerable  technical  difficulties  to  be  overcome      
Shell  people  were  schooled  to  examine  every  aspect  of  a  problem  or  situation  before  making  a  prognosis      
Balanced  properly  between  optimism  and  practicality    the  nondefeatist  attitude  of  the  shell  people  led  them  to  extricate  themselves    their  ships  and  personnel    from  bizarre  situations      
Therefore  to  Helva    the  problem  that  she  couldnt  open  her  mouth  to  sing    among  other  restrictions    did  not  bother  her      
She  would  work  out  a  method    bypassing  her  limitations    whereby  she  could  sing      
She  approached  the  problem  by  investigating  the  methods  of  sound  reproduction  through  the  centuries    human  and  instrumental      
Her  own  sound  production  equipment  was  essentially  more  instrumental  than  vocal      
Breath  control  and  the  proper  enunciation  of  vowel  sounds  within  the  oral  cavity  appeared  to  require  the  most  development  and  practice      
Shell  people  did  not    strictly  speaking    breathe      
For  their  purposes    oxygen  and  other  gases  were  not  drawn  from  the  surrounding  atmosphere  through  the  medium  of  lungs  but  sustained  artificially  by  solution  in  their  shells      
After  experimentation    Helva  discovered  that  she  could  manipulate  her  diaphragmic  unit  to  sustain  tone      
By  relaxing  the  throat  muscles  and  expanding  the  oral  cavity  well  into  the  frontal  sinuses    she  could  direct  the  vowel  sounds  into  the  most  felicitous  position  for  proper  reproduction  through  her  throat  microphone      
She  compared  the  results  with  tape  recordings  of  modern  singers  and  was  not  unpleased  although  her  own  tapes  had  a  peculiar  quality  about  them    not  at  all  unharmonious    merely  unique      
Acquiring  a  repertoire  from  the  Laboratory  library  was  no  problem  to  one  trained  to  perfect  recall      
She  found  herself  able  to  sing  any  role  and  any  song  which  struck  her  fancy      
It  would  not  have  occurred  to  her  that  it  was  curious  for  a  female  to  sing  bass    baritone    tenor    alto    mezzo    soprano  and  coloratura  as  she  pleased      
It  was    to  Helva    only  a  matter  of  the  correct  reproduction  and  diaphragmic  control  required  by  the  music  attempted      
If  the  authorities  remarked  on  her  curious  avocation    they  did  so  among  themselves      
Shell  people  were  encouraged  to  develop  a  hobby  so  long  as  they  maintained  proficiency  in  their  technical  work      
On  the  anniversary  of  her  sixteenth  year  in  her  shell    Helva  was  unconditionally  graduated  and  installed  in  her  ship    the  Aj      
Her  permanent  titanium  shell  was  recessed  behind  an  even  more  indestructible  barrier  in  the  central  shaft  of  the  scout  ship      
The  neural    audio    visual  and  sensory  connections  were  made  and  sealed      
Her  extendibles  were  diverted    connected  or  augmented  and  the  final    delicatebeyonddescription  brain  taps  were  completed  while  Helva  remained  anesthetically  unaware  of  the  proceedings      
When  she  awoke    she  was  the  ship      
Her  brain  and  intelligence  controlled  every  function  from  navigation  to  such  loading  as  a  scout  ship  of  her  class  needed      
She  could  take  care  of  herself  and  her  ambulatory  half    in  any  situation  already  recorded  in  the  annals  of  Central  Worlds  and  any  situation  its  most  fertile  minds  could  imagine      
Her  first  actual  flight    for  she  and  her  kind  had  made  mock  flights  on  dummy  panels  since  she  was  eight    showed  her  complete  mastery  of  the  techniques  of  her  profession      
She  was  ready  for  her  great  entures  and  the  arrival  of  her  mobile  partner      
There  were  nine  qualified  scouts  sitting  around  collecting  base  pay  the  day  Helva  was  commissioned      
There  were  several  missions  which  demanded  instant  attention  but  Helva  had  been  of  interest  to  several  department  heads  in  Central  for  some  time  and  each  man  was  ermined  to  have  her  assigned  to  his  section      
Consequently  no  one  had  remembered  to  introduce  Helva  to  the  prospective  partners      
The  ship  always  chose  its  own  partner      
Had  there  been  another    brain    ship  at  the  Base  at  the  moment    Helva  would  have  been  guided  to  make  the  first  move      
As  it  was    while  Central  wrangled  among  itself    Robert  Tanner  sneaked  out  of  the  pilots  barracks    out  to  the  field  and  over  to  Helvas  slim  metal  hull      
  Hello    anyone  at  home          
Tanner  wisecracked      
  Of  course      replied  Helva  logically    activating  her  outside  scanners      
  Are  you  my  partner          
She  asked  hopefully    as  she  recognized  the  Scout  Service  uniform      
  All  you  have  to  do  is  ask      he  retorted  hopefully      
  No  one  has  come      
I  thought  perhaps  there  were  no  partners  available  and  Ive  had  no  directives  from  Central        
Even  to  herself  Helva  sounded  a  little  selfpitying  but  the  truth  was  she  was  lonely    sitting  on  the  darkened  field      
Always  she  had  had  the  company  of  other  shells  and  more  recently    technicians  by  the  score      
The  sudden  solitude  had  lost  its  momentary  charm  and  become  oppressive      
  No  directives  from  Central  is  scarcely  a  cause  for  regret    but  there  happen  to  be  eight  other  guys  biting  their  fingernails  to  the  quick  just  waiting  for  an  invitation  to  board  you    you  beautiful  thing        
It  would  have  killed  you  in  the  cabin      
Do  you  have  anything  for  me          
Mercer  stammered    not  knowing  what  Bdikkat  meant    and  the  twonosed  man  answered  for  him      I  think  he  has  a  nice  baby  head    but  it  isnt  big  enough  for  you  to  take  yet        
Mercer  never  noticed  the  needle  touch  his  arm      
Bdikkat  had  turned  to  the  next  knot  of  people  when  the  supercondamine  hit  Mercer      
He  tried  to  run  after  Bdikkat    to  hug  the  lead  spacesuit    to  tell  Bdikkat  that  he  loved  him      
He  stumbled  and  fell    but  it  did  not  hurt      
The  manybodied  girl  lay  near  him      
Mercer  spoke  to  her      
  Isnt  it  wonderful        
Youre  beautiful    beautiful    beautiful      
Im  so  happy  to  be  here        
The  woman  covered  with  growing  hands  came  and  sat  beside  them      
She  radiated  warmth  and  good  fellowship      
Mercer  thought  that  she  looked  very  distinguished  and  charming      
He  struggled  out  of  his  clothes      
It  was  foolish  and  snobbish  to  wear  clothing  when  none  of  these  nice  people  did      
The  two  women  babbled  and  crooned  at  him      
With  one  corner  of  his  mind  he  knew  that  they  were  saying  nothing    just  expressing  the  euphoria  of  a  drug  so  powerful  that  the  known  universe  had  forbidden  it      
With  most  of  his  mind  he  was  happy      
He  wondered  how  anyone  could  have  the  good  luck  to  visit  a  planet  as  nice  as  this      
He  tried  to  tell  the  Lady  Da    but  the  words  werent  quite  straight      
A  painful  stab  hit  him  in  the  abdomen      
The  drug  went  after  the  pain  and  swallowed  it      
It  was  like  the  cap  in  the  hospital    only  a  thousand  times  better      
The  pain  was  gone    though  it  had  been  crippling  the  first  time      
He  forced  himself  to  be  deliberate      
He  rammed  his  mind  into  focus  and  said  to  the  two  ladies  who  lay  pinkly  nude  beside  him  in  the  desert      That  was  a  good  bite      
Maybe  I  will  grow  another  head      
That  would  make  Bdikkat  happy          
The  Lady  Da  forced  the  foremost  of  her  bodies  in  an  upright  position      
Said  she      Im  strong    too      
I  can  talk      
Remember    man    remember      
People  never  live  forever      
We  can  die    too    we  can  die  like  real  people      
I  do  so  believe  in  death          
Mercer  smiled  at  her  through  his  happiness      
  Of  course  you  can      
But  isnt  this  nice      
With  this  he  felt  his  lips  thicken  and  his  mind  go  slack      
He  was  wide  awake    but  he  did  not  feel  like  doing  anything      
In  that  beautiful  place    among  all  those  companionable  and  attractive  people    he  sat  and  smiled      
Bdikkat  was  sterilizing  his  knives      
Mercer  wondered  how  long  the  supercondamine  had  lasted  him      
He  endured  the  ministrations  of  the  dromozoa  without  screams  or  movement      
The  agonies  of  nerves  and  itching  of  skin  were  phenomena  which  happened  somewhere  near  him    but  meant  nothing      
He  watched  his  own  body  with  remote    casual  interest      
The  Lady  Da  and  the  handcovered  woman  stayed  near  him      
After  a  long  time  the  halfman  dragged  himself  over  to  the  group  with  his  powerful  arms      
Having  arrived  he  blinked  sleepily  and  friendlily  at  them    and  lapsed  back  into  the  restful  stupor  from  which  he  had  emerged      
Mercer  saw  the  sun  rise  on  occasion    closed  his  eyes  briefly    and  opened  them  to  see  stars  shining      
Time  had  no  meaning      
The  dromozoa  fed  him  in  their  mysterious  way        
the  drug  canceled  out  his  needs  for  cycles  of  the  body      
At  last  he  noticed  a  return  of  the  inwardness  of  pain      
The  pains  themselves  had  not  changed        
he  had      
He  knew  all  the  events  which  could  take  place  on  Shayol      
He  remembered  them  well  from  his  happy  period      
Formerly  he  had  noticed  them    now  he  felt  them      
He  tried  to  ask  the  Lady  Da  how  long  they  had  had  the  drug    and  how  much  longer  they  would  have  to  wait  before  they  had  it  again      
She  smiled  at  him  with  benign    remote  happiness        
apparently  her  many  torsos    stretched  out  along  the  ground    had  a  greater  capacity  for  retaining  the  drug  than  did  his  body      
She  meant  him  well    but  was  in  no  condition  for  articulate  speech      
The  halfman  lay  on  the  ground    arteries  pulsating  prettily  behind  the  halftransparent  film  which  protected  his  abdominal  cavity      
Mercer  squeezed  the  mans  shoulder      
The  halfman  woke    recognized  Mercer  and  gave  him  a  healthily  sleepy  grin      
    A  good  morrow  to  you    my  boy      
Thats  out  of  a  play      
Did  you  ever  see  a  play          
  You  mean  a  game  with  cards          
  No      said  the  halfman      a  sort  of  eyemachine  with  real  people  doing  the  figures        
  I  never  saw  that      said  Mercer      but  I        
  But  you  want  to  ask  me  when  Bdikkat  is  going  to  come  back  with  the  needle        
  Yes      said  Mercer    a  little  ashamed  of  his  obviousness      
  Soon      said  the  halfman      
Thats  why  I  think  of  plays      
We  all  know  what  is  going  to  happen      
We  all  know  when  it  is  going  to  happen      
We  all  know  what  the  dummies  will  do      he  gestured  at  the  hummocks  in  which  the  decorticated  men  were  cradled      and  we  all  know  what  the  new  people  will  ask      
But  we  never  know  how  long  a  scene  is  going  to  take        
  Whats  a    scene            
Asked  Mercer      
  Is  that  the  name  for  the  needle          
The  halfman  laughed  with  something  close  to  real  humor      
  No    no    no      
Youve  got  the  lovelies  on  the  brain      
A  scene  is  just  a  part  of  a  play      
I  mean  we  know  the  order  in  which  things  happen    but  we  have  no  clocks  and  nobody  cares  enough  to  count  days  or  to  make  calendars  and  theres  not  much  climate  here    so  none  of  us  know  how  long  anything  takes      
The  pain  seems  short  and  the  pleasure  seems  long      
Im  inclined  to  think  that  they  are  about  two  Earthweeks  each        
Mercer  did  not  know  what  an    Earthweek    was    since  he  had  not  been  a  wellread  man  before  his  conviction    but  he  got  nothing  more  from  the  halfman  at  that  time      
The  halfman  received  a  dromozootic  implant    turned  red  in  the  face    shouted  senselessly  at  Mercer      Take  it  out    you  fool        
Take  it  out  of  me          
When  Mercer  looked  on  helplessly    the  halfman  twisted  over  on  his  side    his  pink  dusty  back  turned  to  Mercer    and  wept  hoarsely  and  quietly  to  himself      
Mercer  himself  could  not  tell  how  long  it  was  before  Bdikkat  came  back      
It  might  have  been  several  days      
It  might  have  been  several  months      
Once  again  Bdikkat  moved  among  them  like  a  father        
once  again  they  clustered  like  children      
This  time  Bdikkat  smiled  pleasantly  at  the  little  head  which  had  grown  out  of  Mercers  thigh    a  sleeping  childs  head    covered  with  light  hair  on  top  and  with  dainty  eyebrows  over  the  resting  eyes      
Mercer  got  the  blissful  needle      
When  Bdikkat  cut  the  head  from  Mercers  thigh    he  felt  the  knife  grinding  against  the  cartilage  which  held  the  head  to  his  own  body      
He  saw  the  childface  grimace  as  the  head  was  cut        
he  felt  the  far    cool  flash  of  unimportant  pain    as  Bdikkat  dabbed  the  wound  with  a  corrosive  antiseptic  which  stopped  all  bleeding  immediately      
The  next  time  it  was  two  legs  growing  from  his  chest      
Then  there  had  been  another  head  beside  his  own      
Or  was  that  after  the  torso  and  legs    waist  to  toetips    of  the  little  girl  which  had  grown  from  his  side        
He  forgot  the  order      
He  did  not  count  time      
Lady  Da  smiled  at  him  often    but  there  was  no  love  in  this  place      
She  had  lost  the  extra  torsos      
In  between  teratologies    she  was  a  pretty  and  shapely  woman        
but  the  nicest  thing  about  their  relationship  was  her  whisper  to  him    repeated  some  thousands  of  time    repeated  with  smiles  and  hope      People  never  live  forever        
She  found  this  immensely  comforting    even  though  Mercer  did  not  make  much  sense  out  of  it      
Thus  events  occurred    and  victims  changed  in  appearance    and  new  ones  arrived      
Sometimes  Bdikkat  took  the  new  ones    resting  in  the  everlasting  sleep  of  their  burnedout  brains    in  a  groundtruck  to  be  added  to  other  herds      
The  bodies  in  the  truck  threshed  and  bawled  without  human  speech  when  the  dromozoa  struck  them      
Finally    Mercer  did  manage  to  follow  Bdikkat  to  the  door  of  the  cabin      
He  had  to  fight  the  bliss  of  supercondamine  to  do  it      
Only  the  memory  of  previous  hurt    bewilderment  and  perplexity  made  him  sure  that  if  he  did  not  ask  Bdikkat  when  he    Mercer    was  happy    the  answer  would  no  longer  be  available  when  he  needed  it      
Fighting  pleasure  itself    he  begged  Bdikkat  to  check  the  records  and  to  tell  him  how  long  he  had  been  there      
Bdikkat  grudgingly  agreed    but  he  did  not  come  out  of  the  doorway      
He  spoke  through  the  public  address  box  built  into  the  cabin    and  his  gigantic  voice  roared  out  over  the  empty  plain    so  that  the  pink  herd  of  talking  people  stirred  gently  in  their  happiness  and  wondered  what  their  friend  Bdikkat  might  be  wanting  to  tell  them      
When  he  said  it    they  thought  it  exceedingly  profound    though  none  of  them  understood  it    since  it  was  simply  the  amount  of  time  that  Mercer  had  been  on  Shayol      
  Standard  years    eightyfour  years    seven  months    three  days    two  hours    eleven  and  one  half  minutes      
Good  luck    fellow        
Mercer  turned  away      
The  secret  little  corner  of  his  mind    which  stayed  sane  through  happiness  and  pain    made  him  wonder  about  Bdikkat      
What  persuaded  the  cowman  to  remain  on  Shayol        
What  kept  him  happy  without  supercondamine        
Was  Bdikkat  a  crazy  slave  to  his  own  duty  or  was  he  a  man  who  had  hopes  of  going  back  to  his  own  planet  some  day    surrounded  by  a  family  of  little  cowpeople  resembling  himself        
Mercer    despite  his  happiness    wept  a  little  at  the  strange  fate  of  Bdikkat      
His  own  fate  he  accepted      
He  remembered  the  last  time  he  had  eaten    actual  eggs  from  an  actual  pan      
The  dromozoa  kept  him  alive    but  he  did  not  know  how  they  did  it      
He  staggered  back  to  the  group      
The  Lady  Da    naked  in  the  dusty  plain    waved  a  hospitable  hand  and  showed  that  there  was  a  place  for  him  to  sit  beside  her      
There  were  unclaimed  square  miles  of  seating  space  around  them    but  he  appreciated  the  kindliness  of  her  gesture  none  the  less      
4      
The  years    if  they  were  years    went  by      
The  land  of  Shayol  did  not  change      
Sometimes  the  bubbling  sound  of  geysers  came  faintly  across  the  plain  to  the  herd  of  men        
those  who  could  talk  declared  it  to  be  the  breathing  of  Captain  Alvarez      
There  was  night  and  day    but  no  setting  of  crops    no  change  of  season    no  generations  of  men      
Time  stood  still  for  these  people    and  their  load  of  pleasure  was  so  commingled  with  the  shocks  and  pains  of  the  dromozoa  that  the  words  of  the  Lady  Da  took  on  very  remote  meaning      
  People  never  live  forever        
Her  statement  was  a  hope    not  a  truth  in  which  they  could  believe      
They  did  not  have  the  wit  to  follow  the  stars  in  their  courses    to  exchange  names  with  each  other    to  harvest  the  experience  of  each  for  the  wisdom  of  all      
There  was  no  dream  of  escape  for  these  people      
Though  they  saw  the  oldstyle  chemical  rockets  lift  up  from  the  field  beyond  Bdikkats  cabin    they  did  not  make  plans  to  hide  among  the  frozen  crop  of  transmuted  flesh      
Far  long  ago    some  other  prisoner  than  one  of  these  had  tried  to  write  a  letter      
His  handwriting  was  on  a  rock      
Mercer  read  it    and  so  had  a  few  of  the  others    but  they  could  not  tell  which  man  had  done  it      
Nor  did  they  care      
The  letter    scraped  on  stone    had  been  a  message  home      
They  could  still  read  the  opening      Once    I  was  like  you    stepping  out  of  my  window  at  the  end  of  day    and  letting  the  winds  blow  me  gently  toward  the  place  I  lived  in      
Once    like  you    I  had  one  head    two  hands    ten  fingers  on  my  hands      
The  front  part  of  my  head  was  called  a  face    and  I  could  talk  with  it      
Now  I  can  only  write    and  that  only  when  I  get  out  of  pain      
Dan  Morgan  told  himself  he  would  forget  Ann  Turner      
He  was  well  rid  of  her      
He  certainly  didnt  want  a  wife  who  was  fickle  as  Ann      
If  he  had  married  her    hed  have  been  asking  for  trouble      
But  all  of  this  was  rationalization      
Sometimes  he  woke  up  in  the  middle  of  the  night  thinking  of  Ann    and  then  could  not  get  back  to  sleep      
His  plans  and  dreams  had  revolved  around  her  so  much  and  for  so  long  that  now  he  felt  as  if  he  had  nothing      
The  easiest  thing  would  be  to  sell  out  to  Al  Budd  and  leave  the  country    but  there  was  a  stubborn  streak  in  him  that  wouldnt  allow  it      
The  best  antidote  for  the  bitterness  and  disappointment  that  poisoned  him  was  hard  work      
He  found  that  if  he  was  tired  enough  at  night    he  went  to  sleep  simply  because  he  was  too  exhausted  to  stay  awake      
Each  day  he  found  himself  thinking  less  often  of  Ann        
each  day  the  hurt  was  a  little  duller    a  little  less  poignant      
He  had  plenty  of  work  to  do      
Because  the  summer  was  unusually  dry  and  hot    the  spring  produced  a  smaller  stream  than  in  ordinary  years      
The  grass  in  the  meadows  came  fast    now  that  the  warm  weather  was  here      
He  could  not  afford  to  lose  a  drop  of  the  precious  water    so  he  spent  most  of  his  waking  hours  along  the  ditches  in  his  meadows      
He  had  no  idea  how  much  time  Budd  would  give  him      
In  any  case    he  had  no  intention  of  being  caught  asleep    so  he  carried  his  revolver  in  its  holster  on  his  hip  and  he  took  his  Winchester  with  him  and  leaned  it  against  the  fence      
He  stopped  every  few  minutes  and  leaned  on  his  shovel  as  he  studied  the  horizon    but  nothing  happened    each  day  dragging  out  with  monotonous  calm      
When    in  late  afternoon  on  the  last  day  in  June    he  saw  two  people  top  the  ridge  to  the  south  and  walk  toward  the  house    he  quit  work  immediately  and  strode  to  his  rifle      
It  could  be  some  kind  of  trick  Budd  had  thought  up      
No  one  walked  in  this  country    least  of  all  Ed  Dow  or  Dutch  Renfro  or  any  of  the  rest  of  the  Bar  B  crew      
Morgan  watched  the  two  figures  for  a  time    puzzled      
When  they  were  closer  and  he  saw  that  one  was  a  woman    he  was  more  puzzled  than  ever      
He  cleaned  his  shovel    left  it  against  the  fence    picked  up  his  Winchester    and  started  downstream      
His  visitors  had  crawled  through  the  south  fence  and  were  crossing  the  meadow    angling  toward  the  house      
Now  he  saw  that  both  the  man  and  woman  were  moving  slowly  and  irregularly    staggering    as  if  they  found  it  a  struggle  to  remain  on  their  feet      
Reaching  the  house  ahead  of  them    he  waited  with  his  Winchester  in  his  hands      
They  crawled  through  the  north  fence  and  came  on  toward  him    and  now  he  saw  that  both  were  young    not  more  than  nineteen  or  twenty      
They  were  dirty    their  clothes  were  torn    and  the  girl  was  so  exhausted  that  she  fell  when  she  was  still  twenty  feet  from  the  front  door      
She  lay  there    making  no  effort  to  get  back  on  her  feet      
The  boy  came  on  to  the  porch  and  sat  down    his  gaze  on  Morgan  as  if  half  expecting  him  to  shoot  and  not  really  caring      
Morgan  hesitated    thinking  that  if  this  was  a  trick    it  was  a  good  one      
He  didnt  think  it  was  possible  for  this  couple  to  be  pretending      
The  boy  licked  his  dry  lips      
He  asked      Could  we  have  a  drink          
Morgan  jerked  his  head  toward  the  front  door      
  In  the  kitchen      he  said      
Leaning  his  Winchester  against  the  front  of  the  house    he  walked  to  the  girl      
  Get  up      
Theres  water  in  the  house        
She  didnt  move  or  say  anything      
Her  eyes  were  glazed  as  if  she  didnt  hear  or  even  see  him      
She  had  reached  a  point  at  which  she  didnt  even  care  how  she  looked      
Her  face  was  very  thin    and  burned  by  the  sun  until  much  of  the  skin  was  dead  and  peeling    the  new  skin  under  it  red  and  angry      
Her  blond  hair  was  frowzy    her  dress  torn  in  several  places    and  her  shoes  were  so  completely  worn  out  that  they  were  practically  no  protection      
It  must  have  hurt  her  even  to  walk    for  the  sole  was  completely  off  her  left  foot  and  Morgan  saw  that  it  was  bruised  and  bleeding      
He  picked  her  up    sliding  one  hand  under  her  shoulders    the  other  under  her  knees    and  carried  her  into  the  house      
She  was  amazingly  light    and  so  relaxed  in  his  arms  that  he  wasnt  even  sure  she  was  conscious      
Any  lingering  suspicion  that  this  was  a  trick  Al  Budd  had  thought  up  was  dispelled      
No  girl  would  go  this  far  to  fool  a  man  so  she  could  kill  him      
Besides    she  had  a  sweet  face  that  attracted  him      
He  put  her  down  on  the  couch    and  going  into  the  kitchen    saw  that  the  boy  had  dropped  into  a  chair  beside  the  table      
They  looked  a  good  deal  alike    Morgan  thought      
Both  had  blonde  hair  and  blue  eyes    and  there  was  even  a  faint  similarity  of  features      
Morgan  filled  the  dipper  from  the  water  bucket  on  the  shelf    went  back  into  the  front  room    lifted  the  girls  head    and  held  the  edge  of  the  dipper  to  her  mouth      
She  drank  greedily    and  murmured      Thank  you      as  he  lowered  her  head      
He  stood  looking  down  at  her  for  a  moment    wondering  what  could  have  reduced  her  to  this  condition      
He  had  seen  a  few  nester  wagons  go  through  the  country    the  families  almost  starving  to  death    but  he  had  never  seen  any  of  them  on  foot  and  as  bad  off  as  these  two      
The  girl  dropped  off  to  sleep      
Morgan  returned  to  the  kitchen    built  a  fire    and  carried  in  several  buckets  of  water  from  the  spring  which  he  poured  into  the  copper  boiler  that  he  had  placed  on  the  stove      
He  brought  his  Winchester  in  from  the  front  of  the  house    then  faced  the  boy      
  Who  are  you  and  what  happened  to  you          
He  asked      
  Im  Billy  Jones      the  boy  answered      
  Thats  my  wife  Sharon      
We  ran  out  of  money  and  we  havent  eaten  for  two  days        
  What  are  you  doing  here          
  Are  we  in  Wyoming          
Morgan  nodded      
  About  five  miles  north  of  the  line        
Jones  sighed  as  if  relieved      
  Weve  been  looking  for  work    but  all  the  ranchers  have  turned  us  down        
  You  mean  you  dragged  your  wife  all  over  hells  halfacre  looking  for  work          
Morgan  demanded      
  The  town  of  Buckhorns  only  about  six  miles  from  here      
Why  didnt  you  go  there          
  We  didnt  want  town  work      Jones  said      
  This  is  a  mighty  empty  country      Morgan  said      
  Theres  only  one  more  ranch  three  miles  north  of  here      
Youd  have  starved  to  death  if  youd  missed  both  places        
  Then  were  lucky  we  got  here      
Could  you  give  us  a  job    Mr      
  Morgan      
Dan  Morgan        
He  was  silent  a  moment    thinking  he  could  use  a  man  this  time  of  year    and  if  the  girl  could  cook    it  would  give  him  more  time  in  the  meadows    but  he  knew  nothing  about  the  couple      
They  might  kill  him  in  his  sleep    thinking  there  was  money  in  the  house      
He  dismissed  the  possibility  at  once      
The  girls  thin  face  haunted  him      
It  wasnt  the  face  of  a  killer      
He  wasnt  so  sure  about  the  boy      
He  hadnt  shaved  for  several  weeks    his  sparse  beard  giving  his  face  a  pathetic    woebegone  expression      
There  was  more  to  this  than  Jones  had  told  him      
They  were  running  from  something      
Hed  be  an  idiot  to  let  them  stay  he  thought    but  he  couldnt  send  them  on    either      
  I  could  use  some  help      Morgan  said  finally      but  I  cant  afford  to  pay  you  anything      
I  guess  youd  better  go  on  in  the  morning        
  Well  work  for  our  keep      the  boy  said  eagerly      
  Ive  been  mucking  in  a  mine  in  the  San  Juan    but  I  used  to  work  on  a  ranch      
Sharon    shes  cooked  in  a  restaurant      
Well  work  hard    Mr  Morgan        
  Ill  see      Morgan  said      
  Right  now  you  need  a  meal  and  a  bath      
Your  wifes  in  terrible  shape        
  I  know      Jones  said  dejectedly      
Morgan  filled  the  fire  box  with  wood  again    then  started  supper  and  set  the  table      
When  the  meal  was  ready    he  told  Jones  to  wash  up    and  going  into  the  front  room    woke  the  girl      
He  said      Ive  got  some  supper  ready        
She  rubbed  her  eyes  and  stretched    then  sat  up    her  hands  going  to  her  hair      
  Im  a  mess      she  said    and  suddenly  she  was  alarmed      
  Who  are  you        
How  did  we  get  here          
  Im  Dan  Morgan      
This  is  the  Rafter  Aj      
You  fell  down  in  front  of  the  house    and  I  carried  you  in      
I  gave  you  a  drink  and  then  you  went  to  sleep        
  Oh        
She  stared  at  him    her  eyes  wide  as  she  thought  about  what  he  had  said        
then  she  murmured      Youre  very  kind    Mr  Morgan      
Do  you  take  in  all  the  strays  who  come  by          
  I  dont  have  many  strays  coming  to  my  front  door      he  said      
  Think  you  can  walk  to  the  table          
  Of  course        
She  got  to  her  feet    staggered    and  almost  fell      
He  caught  her  by  an  arm  and  helped  her  into  the  kitchen      
She  sat  down  at  the  table    shaking  her  head      
  Im  sorry    Mr  Morgan      
Im  usually  a  very  strong  woman    but  Im  awfully  tired        
  And  hungry      he  said      
  Start  in      
Its  not  much  of  a  meal    but  its  what  I  eat        
  Not  much  of  a  meal          
The  girl  cried      
  Mr  Morgan    its  the  bestlooking  food  I  ever  saw        
He  told  himself  he  had  never  seen  two  people  eat  so  much      
When  they  were  finally  satisfied    Jones  said      I  think  hes  going  to  give  us  work        
The  grateful  way  she  looked  at  Morgan  made  him  ashamed  of  himself      
When  he  saw  the  expression  in  her  eyes    he  knew  he  couldnt  send  them  on      
She  said      I  guess  the  Lord  looks  out  for  fools    drunkards    and  innocents        
Morgan  laughed      
  Which  are  you          
  Were  not  drunkards      she  said      
  Thats  all  Im  sure  of        
She  helped  him  with  the  dishes    then  he  brought  more  water  in  from  the  spring  before  it  got  dark      
He  carried  the  tub  from  the  back  of  the  house  where  it  hung  from  a  nail  in  the  wall      
He  said      Youll  feel  a  lot  better  after  you  have  a  bath      
Your  feet  are  in  bad  shape    Mrs  Jones      
Youll  have  to  go  to  town  to  see  the  doc        
  No    shell  be  all  right      Jones  said  quickly      
  I  mean    we  dont  have  any  way  to  get  there  and  we  cant  expect  you  to  quit  work  just  to  take  us  to  town        
  Well  see      Morgan  said      
  Could  you  find  me  a  needle  and  thread          
The  girl  asked      
  My  dress  needs  some  work  on  it        
He  nodded  and    going  into  the  bedroom    brought  a  needle    thread    and  scissors      
He  said      Im  going  to  bed        
He  nodded  at  the  door  in  front  of  him      
  Thats  my  spare  bedroom      
The  bed  isnt  made    but  youll  find  plenty  of  blankets  there        
  Youre  awfully  kind      the  girl  said      
  Well  pay  you  back  if  youll  let  us      
Some  way        
  Its  all  right      he  said      
  I  get  up  early      
Youd  better  sleep        
Jones  followed  him  into  the  front  room    closing  the  door  behind  him      
He  said      If  its  all  right  with  you    Mr  Morgan    Ill  sleep  out  here  on  the  couch      
We  havent  slept  together  since  we  started      
I  just  cant  take  any  chances  on  getting  her  pregnant    and  if  we  were  sleeping  together      
He  stopped    embarrassed    and  Morgan  said      I  understand  that    but  I  dont  savvy  why  youd  go  off  and  leave  your  jobs  in  the  first  place        
  We  got  fired      Jones  said      
  We  had  to  do  something        
They  were  a  pair  of  lost    whipped  kids    Morgan  thought  as  he  went  to  bed      
Gavin  paused  wearily      
  You  cant  stay  here  with  me      
Its  late  and  you  said  theyd  be  here  by  dawn
